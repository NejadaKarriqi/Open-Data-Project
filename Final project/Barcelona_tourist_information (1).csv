<p>Perched on the hill that borders Sants and looks towards the sea, Montjuïc has witnessed and been the setting for many momentous events in Barcelona&#8217;s history. It began to be developed round the 1929 <strong>International Exposition</strong>. Following the dramatic events of the Civil War, when the castle served as a prison, it changed and, with the 1992 <strong>Olympic Games</strong>, the change was completed. For the people of Barcelona it acquired a happy, festive character again.</p>
<p>The name of the hill, which is 177 metres high, has been the subject of controversy as, in medieval Catalan, Montjuïc could translate as &#8220;<strong>Jewish mountain</strong>&#8220;, an interpretation backed up by the existence of a Jewish cemetery there.</p>
<h3>Nature, culture and sport</h3>
<p>There are lots of gardens on this big, green, city lung where you can walk, rest, play, do sport or just enjoy nature. The <strong>Jardí Botànic</strong> lays out its collection of Mediterranean plants on steep slopes that provide a great viewpoint. You can also enjoy the plants and views in the <strong>Jardins de Mossèn Costa i Llobera</strong>, featuring cactus, and the <strong>Jardins de </strong><strong>Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer</strong>,where the numerous species means there are flowers in bloom all year round. The<strong> Jardins de Laribal</strong>, with their surprising waterfalls, hide the popular <strong>Font del Gat</strong>, a fountain where Barcelona folk went to picnic on Sundays in the past. And the <strong>Jardins Joan Brossa</strong>, among the newest gardens, open out into a refreshing woodland park, with musical cushions, games and zip lines here and there to amuse the kids.</p>
<p>Dotted with cultural and sports facilities, such as the Miró Foundation, CaixaForum, Bernat Picornell Swimming Pools and the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium, Montjuïc offers culture, nature and history all in one. The Magic Fountain (Font Màgica) and Spanish Village (Poble Espanyol) are two of the sights that most appeal to visitors in an enormous natural space full of hidden corners waiting to be discovered.</p>

Then the site brought together people from all over the world and contributed to the dialogue on <strong>cultural diversity</strong>, sustainable development and the conditions for peace.</p>
<p>Walking through the park now you can still feel the essence of those dialogues that began ten years ago. <strong>Parc dels Auditoris</strong>, one of the areas that has been reclaimed, is a large, open-air space by the sea, with a spectacular photovoltaic panel suspended in a forest of very peculiar columns that has become a real symbol of the commitment to <strong>sustainability and the environment</strong>.</p>
<p>Various acts and <strong>big events</strong> are held throughout the park during the year that have had an international echo, and the fact that it can hold 65,000 people at any one time has turned it into a meeting point for people from all over the world.</p>
<h3><strong>A versatile space</strong></h3>
<p>In reality it is not a green space or urban park in the usual sense, rather it is a <strong>big area</strong> that combines a number of spaces and facilities where all kinds of <strong>acts and events</strong> are held today.</p>
<p>The park&#8217;s central stage is a reclaimed area in front of the sea, with an <strong>esplanade</strong> that holds <strong>fairs </strong>like the Catalan version of Seville&#8217;s April Fair, <strong>music festivals</strong> such as Primavera Sound and large-scale events of other kinds.</p>
<p>Inside the park you will also find the Fòrum Building, which houses the <strong>Museu Blau</strong> and the <strong>CCIB</strong>, <strong>the Barcelona International Conference Centre</strong>, which holds a large number of big conferences in the course of the year. Regarded as being <strong>unique in Europe</strong>, for its beauty and original architecture, and with a capacity of 15,000 people, it is a very versatile, multipurpose meeting centre with spectacular views of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>This exhibition, <strong><em>Planet Life</em></strong>, invites visitors on a journey through the history of life and its evolution in line with our planet, and a visit to the museum, with its innovative layout, approach and interactive audiovisual resources, is a great way of discovering and understanding nature&#8217;s secrets.</p>
<h3>Innovation, science and fun</h3>
<p>With9,000 square metresof facilities and services, the Museu Blau also offers temporary exhibitions, a Media Library, the <strong>Science Nest</strong> for children aged 0 to 6 and a function room. On top of that it holds talks and workshops, making it a truly <strong>active, living centre</strong>.</p>
<p>The new museum&#8217;s <strong>innovative cultural approach</strong> combines <strong>scientific rigour</strong> with a <strong>sense of fun</strong>. This makes it possible to combine concepts that, at first site, appear mutually opposed. Because here it is understood that an understanding of nature and serious debate on contemporary environmental issues can go hand in hand with <strong>fun and recreation</strong>.</p>

<p>During the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona was the first city to be <strong>systematically bombed </strong>from the air. The city&#8217;s people set up the Passive Defence Council, which built a great number of <strong>air-raid shelters </strong>around Barcelona to protect themselves. There is evidence of almost 1,300 bomb shelters, and that of <strong>Poble-sec</strong> was among the largest, able to hold around 2000 people.</p>
<p>Built by the <strong>local residents </strong>themselves, Refugi 307 takes advantage of the topography and the <strong>slope of Montjuïc</strong>, where it is located, which enables it to have a street-level entrance at the end of Carrer Nou de la Rambla. Inside, it opens up into a <strong>network </strong>of almost 400 m of <strong>tunnels</strong>, which have electricity, a toilet, kitchen, seating and a play area for the little ones, as well as a <strong>small nursing station </strong>that could tend to the injured.</p>
<h3>Indelible memory</h3>
<p>As a historical location testifying to the difficulties of that era, today Refugi 307 is managed by the Museu d’Història de Barcelona (MUHBA). A <strong>guided tour </strong>allows you to walk through the tunnels and see the elements that still remain from those times, like posters stuck on the wall specifying some surprising <strong>rules for coexistence</strong>, such as forbidding you to talk about politics and religion or foster pessimism. A real legacy of the <strong>atrocities of war</strong>.</p>

<p>The origins of the&nbsp;Teatre Nacional de Catalunya ;are linked to the <strong>theatre tradition</strong> of the country, which has always been highly <strong>rich and creative</strong>, as well as daring, and this continues today. In the 1980s, Catalan society sensed that it needed a place where actors and directors could work freely. The creation of the TNC is also closely associated with the outstanding actor <strong>Josep Maria Flotats</strong> who, after returning from France in the 1980s following the end of the Franco dictatorship, took on a prominent role in institutionalising Catalan theatre and he became the first director of the new Teatre Nacional de Catalunya.</p>
<h3>Interdisciplinary stage</h3>
<p>Since it was created in 1996, the TNC has experienced many phases with various proposals, but it has always been committed to <strong>maximum quality</strong> and providing an area to promote other disciplines, such as dance, opera and puppetry. Today it is directed by <strong>Xavier Albertí</strong> with a varied, national and international programme. Apart from enjoying one of the performances staged, it is also worth making a visit for the architectural value of its avant-garde building, designed by the architect <strong>Ricard Bofill</strong>.</p>

Two years later the <strong>first popular science museum</strong> in the whole of Spain and one of the best in Europe, opened there. This was an innovative idea for taking science to the public.</p>
<p>Following a <strong>refurbishment</strong> in 2004 that expanded the museum&#8217;s facilities to the current 50,000 square metres, it was renamed CosmoCaixa and is known by that name today.</p>
<h3>A place to enjoy</h3>
<p>Museum highlights include the <strong>Planetarium</strong>, which offers an extraordinary space voyage, travelling though time to the stars and planets; the <strong>Geological Wall</strong>, consisting of seven large cuts of real rock for geological interpretation; the <strong>Matter Room</strong>, where you can become a scientist and set the limits to physics; and the <strong>Flooded Forest</strong>, which recreates an Amazonian ecosystem including animal and plant species from that part of the world. To create this exhibition, scientists travelled to the Brazilian state of Pará to make exact moulds and faithful reproductions of the large trees and plants that grow there.</p>
<p>CosmoCaixa represents a real <strong>challenge to the senses</strong> and it is one of the best leisure options in the city, designed for young and old alike. Housed in a landmark building, it has put Modernisme at the service of the most modern science.</p>

<p>The national art museum holds the best <strong>collection of Romanesque murals</strong> in the world, lots of them rescued from small rural churches in the <strong>Pyrenees</strong> and transported to Barcelona to protect Catalonia&#8217;s heritage. These original, post 11th-century paintings, such as those of Sant Quirze de Pedret and Santa Maria d’Àneu, are of unique value.</p>
<p>One of the masterpieces in the collection consists of the paintings from the Sant Climent de Taüll apse, with the famous <strong><em>Pantocrator</em> </strong>or <em>Christ in Majesty</em>, unquestionably the masterpiece of the 12th century and tangible proof of the creative power of Catalan painting.</p>
<h3>A big art gallery</h3>
<p>The museum houses works by the best representatives of <strong>Catalan Modernisme</strong> too, such as Gaudí and Casas. It also has a collection of <strong>Gothic art</strong> and another of work by European Renaissance painters, for example, Titian and Velázquez. Interest in its <strong>contemporary art collection</strong> focuses on the works of Solana, Dalí and Alfred Sisley,</p>
<p>The museum&#8217;s origins date back to 1934, when it opened with a medieval collection. Gradually it turned into the big museum we know today, adding the famous Romanesque art exhibition hall and, finally, in 2004, the modern art collection.</p>

<p>The Casa de la Caritat, or House of Charity, was established in the <strong>early 19th century </strong>as a place for accommodating the city&#8217;s beggars and forsaken people. It was a means of reducing poverty in the area but, over time, this building, built during the splendour of Modernisme, has come to serve a very different purpose. The Casa de la Caritat is now a cultural complex which, situated in the Raval neighbourhood, has filled the area with <em>art and culture</em>. The Barcelona Contemporary Culture Centre, or CCCB, is housed in the main building and it is here that the most modern aspects of the city&#8217;s culture can be seen: exhibitions, concerts, debates and festivals, always with a focus on new technologies and new languages. An ever emerging space of <strong>creators and artists </strong>which has a theatre and a laboratory centre for new creations and which forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, an initiative that aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>
<h3>An open space</h3>
<p>The project to convert the Casa de la Caritat into the <strong>CCCB </strong>won the FAD Design Award in 1993. A welcoming prismatic structure and a glass facade, which appears to be leaning over the <strong>Pati de les Dones</strong>, have become one of the city&#8217;s key landmarks. The mirrors and their reflections are a metaphor for the way the city&#8217;s landscape is constantly changing, without losing its essence.</p>
<p>In the centre there is a square, <strong>Plaça de les Dones</strong>, around which there is the Ramon Llull University and spaces belonging to the Museum of Contemporary Art which complete the centre&#8217;s cultural offering.</p>
<p>The <strong>Pati Manning</strong>, the former cloister of the Casa de la Caritat seminary, is worthy of a special visit. It is a <strong>17th century cloister</strong>, nestled between the avant-garde and the new artistic languages. A cloister that, with its semicircular arches and sgraffito on the walls, speaks of a history which is very much alive in a building that has managed to transform itself into an important cultural focal point. A good time to visit it is during the <strong>La Mercè</strong> festival, which is when the traditional giants from all the surrounding neighbourhoods are installed here.</p>

<p>After some thorough remodelling, the station reopened in 1992, to mark with the Barcelona Olympic Games.

Recent years have seen a rise in the station&#8217;s <strong> cultural importance</strong>.

<p>Parc del Laberint d’Horta is the only one of its kind in the city, <strong>a bucolic and historical space </strong>in the <strong>Horta-Guinardó</strong> district that was constructed in the late 18th century, and is the oldest park in Barcelona.</p>
<p>It is comprised of <strong>two different gardens </strong>: one, an 18th century <strong>Neoclassical </strong>garden which extends across three stepped terraces and revolves around the theme of love, and another 19th century <strong>Romantic </strong>garden, which revolves around the theme of death and is located on the left side of the park. When you enter the cypress tree maze in the centre of the park, which has become an iconic spot, you are rewarded with the famous statue of Eros, and nearby, at the exit, the grotto of Echo and Narcissus.</p>
<h3>An open-air museum</h3>
<p>Considered to be a <strong>garden-museum</strong>, the Laberint d’Horta has also been used as the setting for a number of films that wanted to capture its charm. These include <em>Perfume</em>, by director Tom Tykwer, released in 2006. The park contains both Neoclassical and Romantic features that create a curious mix that appeals to all visitors: <strong>pavilions </strong>with Tuscan columns, <strong>mythological sculptures</strong>, symmetrical gardens, <strong>fountains and water jets </strong>that form a <strong>waterfall</strong> at the same time, moss and wild plants, gardens that are more wild and less landscaped, and so on. Wild nature and domesticated nature, both coming together in a single place representing the two opposing spirits of each era. It was created by Italian <strong>gardener Domenico Bagutti</strong>, commissioned by Marquis Antoni Desvalls, who owned the estate until the 1960s when it became a place for public use. It is open to the public every day but has a <strong>limited capacity </strong>of 750 people.</p>

<p>As soon as you walk through the main gate, flanked by two buildings that look as if they have been lifted straight out of a fairy tale, you enter a <strong>different world</strong>, an original, enchanting universe where <strong>architecture and gardens</strong> merge to create a dreamlike landscape. The <strong>dragon, covered in ceramic mosaic</strong>, keeps an eye on the visitors who are on the look out for every last detail: snails, mushrooms, flowers, and leaves. Every nook and cranny of the park leads to a discovery.</p>
<p>At the start of the 20th century, <strong>Eusebi Güell</strong>, a leading figure in the city, wanted to create a place where the wealthy could have a home, a <strong>city garden</strong> in the English style, which explains why it is called Park Güell. Paths, staircases, a square, a service pavilion and even a <strong>demonstration home</strong> were all built but the project flopped. So, in 1922, six years after Eusebi Güell died, Barcelona City Council bought the land and turned the site into a <strong>public park</strong>, the most unusual in the city.</p>
<p><strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>&#8216;s boundless imagination is present in every corner of the park, which holds surprising features for the visitors who come from all over the world. The ceramic dragon at the entrance gives way to a <strong>hypostyle hall</strong>, an open space with 86 Doric columns that was supposed to have held the garden-city market. The square above it, which grows out of the mountain and symbolises the <strong>union of nature and architecture</strong>, is bordered by an <strong>undulating bench </strong>covered by a ceramic mosaic, which was designed by a disciple of Gaudí, Josep Maria Juju. The bench, softened by its wavy features, offers one of the best <strong>views of the city</strong>.</p>
<p>It is not just the bench that snakes its way round, the <strong>paths</strong>, <strong>porticoes</strong> and <strong>viaducts</strong> do too. Avoiding straight lines, Gaudí imagined a style of architecture in harmony with plant life and nature, forming a symbiosis between stone and green.</p>
<p>Faced with the failure of the project and realising that not even one house would be sold, Gaudí himself lived in the demonstration home until 1926. Today it houses the <strong>Museu Gaudí</strong>, where you can see his drawings, as well as models and furniture he designed.</p>
<p>When Antoni Gaudí qualified as an architect, the university chancellor, Elies Rogent, said: &#8220;We have given this qualification to a genius or a madman, only time will tell&#8221;. Well, Time has given its verdict: since 1984, Park Güell, <strong>Gaudí&#8217;s work of genius</strong>, has been recognised as a <strong>World Heritage site by UNESCO</strong></p>

<p>Ciutadella is one of the parks most admired by the locals. It occupies the land where the fortress and esplanade were built on the orders of Philip V following his victory over the Catalans in the War of Succession. Nearly <strong>one thousand houses</strong> were demolished here and in their place an imposing pentagonal construction was built, from where it was possible to control the whole city: it was the biggest <strong>military fortress</strong> in Europe.</p>
<p>Today, the repressive symbol that Ciutadella represented has long gone, and in the park Barcelona residents of all ages mix with tourists from around the world. There are places to relax, walk, run, cycle, admire the many works of art that adorn it and appreciate the abundant vegetation, including trees planted in the 19th century.</p>
<h3>A place to enjoy and see history</h3>
<p>The park&#8217;s current look is down to Josep Fontserè, who won the urban development competition in 1871 with his plans for a large, landscaped area with flowerbeds, trees and an artificial lake. In the years that followed, the park gradually took shape until the Universal Exposition of 1888 gave it a final boost. That was when the <strong>Cascade Fountain</strong>, greenhouse, bandstand and Castle of Three Dragons were built. Shortly after, a zoo was planned, which opened in 1892.</p>
<p>All that remains of Philip V&#8217;s fortress are a chapel, the Governor&#8217;s Palace, (currently a school) and the arsenal, the seat of the <strong>Parliament of Catalonia </strong>since 1979.</p>
<p>Other features were added at the start of the 20th century, such as the pond in front of the Parliament and the rather unusual <strong>stone </strong>mammoth. The equestrian statue of General Prim is also worthy of note, as is the figure crying in the centre of the pond: a copy of Josep Llimona&#8217;s masterpiece <strong><em>Desconsol</em></strong>, or <strong><em>Despair</em></strong>.</p>

<p>As the city grew and the <strong>Rambla</strong> became more important as a thoroughfare, the itinerant stalls gradually moved backwards and towards the west until they arrived at the foot of the <strong>Convent of Sant Josep</strong> (which has since disappeared and is the origin of the market&#8217;s name). Groups of rioters set fire to it in 1835, on St James&#8217; Night, which became known for the Burning of the Convents. The land it had stood on then became the property of the City Council. There the <strong>square with the porch</strong> was built that can still be seen today, and the market was finally moved indoors, even though today&#8217;s building still did not exist. The municipal architect Josep Mas was given the job of designing a <strong>tall, modern building</strong> made with cast iron to house the stalls. The Boqueria was officially opened in 1840 and the roof was finished in 1916.</p>
<h3 class=""title"">Today</h3>
<p>The Boqueria has become a place to savour with all five senses: walking among the stalls and curious visitors, while enjoying the <strong>colours and the aromas</strong> it offers, is a real pleasure.

<p>You can find everything at the market: fruit and vegetables, fish and seafood, meat, preserves, pulses, cheese and so on. There is local produce and imported food, <strong>Catalan specialities</strong> as well as world cuisine, both traditional and contemporary. <strong>Cultural and gastronomic activities</strong> are held there, including courses, workshops, tasting sessions and meetings.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Boqueria was rewarded with the <strong>Best Market of the Year Award</strong> at the sixth International Public Markets Conference, held in Washington.</p>

<p>Renovated in 2007, the Montjuïc cable car is much more than a means of transport because, thanks to the <strong>privileged views </strong>it offers, it has become one of the mountain&#8217;s big attractions. It is very easy to access, as it stops at <strong>three different points </strong>along its route. The first stop, <strong>Parc de Montjuïc</strong>, is situated on Avinguda Miramar, very close to the funicular railway station that climbs up the mountainside from Paral·lel. From this point you can access some of the most important <strong>cultural attractions </strong>in the park, such as the Joan Miró Foundation, Poble Espanyol and the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC).</p>
<h3>Bird&#8217;s eye view</h3>
<p>Making the journey by cable car gives visitors the opportunity to stop at each station to enjoy everything on offer there. The second stop, Mirador, enables visitors to reach the famous <strong>Mirador de l’Alcalde</strong> vantage point, a landscaped terrace with exceptional views over the Port of Barcelona. Close by is the emblematic <strong>Monument a la Sardana</strong>, and the entrance to the <strong>Jardins de Joan Brossa</strong>. These woodland gardens are a great place to venture into with a childlike spirit, as they are home to musical cushions, zip lines and climbing games.</p>
<p>The third and final stop is <strong>Castell de Montjuïc</strong>, where you can visit this 17th century military fortress and carry on enjoying the spectacular views over a large part of the city from the mountain top.</p>
<p>From the modern cable car cabins, which hold up to 8 people, you can observe the city in motion without losing sight of important buildings such as the Sagrada Família or the Agbar Tower. The experience of gradually zooming out from the city as the cable car climbs the mountain, and the opportunity it provides to get a bird&#8217;s eye view of Barcelona is a unique experience that is well worth trying.</p>

<p>A second of silence is eternal. That which is produced by the public after hearing a perfect symphony or an aria in the pure voice of a soprano. A silence that is broken by thunderous applause. This is what you feel the first time you enter the Palau de la Música. Exuberant, voluptuous, impressive. We will never run out of adjectives to describe architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner&#8217;s magnificent building, the only concert hall to be declared <strong>World Heritage</strong> by UNESCO in 1997, a Modernista building on all four sides that reflects the will of Barcelona to modernise.</p>
<p>Its history began in 1905, when <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong>, one of the founders of Modernisme, was encharged with building a new concert hall for the <strong>Orfeó</strong> <strong>Català</strong>. With total creative freedom, he designed an allegory of nature in nymphs, flowers and plant motifs that made the perfect backdrop for listening to the music. The building was built around a glass-covered metallic structure, a very avant-garde idea for the times, and into it he integrated all the <strong>applied arts</strong>: sculpture, ironwork, stained glass and ceramics. Domènech i Montaner also wanted light to be an architectural element, so large panels of stained glass, other windows and a central skylight let the sun flood into the Palau. The <strong>Modernisme</strong> that is reflected by the Palau de la Música is more than an aesthetic trend: it represents an <strong>ideological movement</strong> that wanted to modernise the city.</p>
<h3>A privileged stage</h3>
<p>From its inauguration in 1908, the Palau de la Música, nestling right in the centre of the Ciutat Vella district, has been a privileged setting for music, but also for politics and ideas. Great musical masters like Enric Granados, Manuel de Falla, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky and Frederic Mompou made their debuts in this auditorium. The Palau de la Música is a benchmark not only in the worlds of music and Modernista architecture: is the symbol of an era in Barcelona, the age when it became a modern city.</p>

<p>In the heart of the Rambla there is one of the <strong>oldest</strong>, most historical theatres in Barcelona: the Gran Teatre del Liceu. The quality of the opera and dance productions performed there, as well as the classical music concerts, make it one of the most <strong>renowned theatres in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>mid 19th century</strong>, distinguished members of Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie decided there was a need to build a theatre befitting the importance the city was acquiring at a time of <strong>economic and cultural expansion</strong>, and this led to the construction of the Liceu in 1847, on the site previously occupied by the <strong>Convent dels Trinitaris Descalços</strong> on the Rambla. The first building was based on plans drawn up by architect Miquel Garriga i Roca with the help of Josep Oriol Mestres. The first serious fire to affect the building occurred in 1861, but it was restored and rose from the ashes as a great opera house. More than a century later, in 1994, the theatre succumbed to another <strong>serious fire</strong>. The building was faithfully reconstructed but the theatre was given a much more modern <strong>technical structure </strong>and was also extended.</p>
<h3><strong>Uniting tradition and modernity</strong></h3>
<p>As a symbol of <strong>culture and distinction </strong>in the city, the Liceu offers a programme that includes <strong>eternal classics </strong>such as Verdi, Mozart and Wagner alongside <strong>new and original concepts </strong>such as the contemporary jazz opera Porgy Bess by George Gershwin. The Liceu is also becoming increasingly committed to education in Catalonia and has established the <strong>Petit Liceu</strong>, a programme of music and arts designed to help young children develop their musical and creative sensibilities from a young age.</p>
<p>When we think of Barcelona, it is impossible not to think of the Rambla and the Liceu and, as a cultural symbol within the city, it is a <strong>benchmark </strong>that everyone should pay a visit to. The Liceu forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, an initiative that aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The successor to the 1401 hospital in the Raval neighbourhood, <strong>Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau</strong> was created at the end of the 19th century by the architect <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong>. Both as a health facility and for its architectural value, it is one of the most extraordinary Modernista sites in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Considered to be the largest <strong>Modernista complex</strong> of Catalan architecture, it was declared a UNESCO <strong>World Heritage</strong> site in 1997. The 12 Gothic Revival-inspired buildings are covered in ceramics and a <strong>wide variety of prized iconography</strong> revealing the creator&#8217;s religious sentiments. The general criteria followed in the construction of these <strong>12 buildings</strong> were common structures,  lighting, ventilation and room decoration.</p>
<h3>Heritage waiting to be discovered</h3>
<p>In 2009, after the Modernista complex had been used as a health centre for more than eight decades, an <strong>ambitious project</strong> moved the hospital to new  facilities at the northern edge of the site, and the historic pavilions were converted into a research and <strong>historical culture</strong> centre.</p>
<p>A place of memories, the Modernista complex currently houses a <strong>research and knowledge centre </strong>comprising institutes linked to health, education and health-related activities. In addition, the administration pavilion contains the <strong>Historical Archives</strong> of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, one of the oldest documentary resources in Europe, with documents from the 15th century, when the hospital was in the Raval neighbourhood, right up to the 20th century. As a base for cultural and educational events,  Hospital de Sant Pau is a <strong>unique place to visit</strong> that that takes you through decades of Barcelona&#8217;s science, history and architecture.</p>

<p>The Born opened in 1876 as a <strong>municipal market</strong> and was one of the first buildings in Barcelona built with an <strong>exposed iron</strong> framework, following the European trend at the time. Little did anyone suspect then that underneath the new construction there lay hidden an <strong>archaeological site </strong>of great historical significance for the city.</p>
<p>Taking his inspiration from Les Halles in Paris, the architect Josep Fontserè designed a tall, open, functional space, which stood out for its metal structure, central dome and glazed-tile roof. In 1921 it became the central wholesale market, which operated until 1971 and was restored in 1977, although it was no longer in use.</p>
<h3>The lost city</h3>
<p class=""Peromissi"">At the end of 2001, while work was being carried out on the site to house the Provincial Library, the <strong>remains of houses</strong> that had formed part of the Ribera neighbourhood came to light. Following that discovery, the alteration work was suspended and, four years later, the Catalan government declared it to be a <strong>Cultural Asset of National Interest</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though the site discovered at the Born represents less than 10% of <em>ground zero</em>, its excellent state of preservation has made it possible to recreate the life in<strong> Barcelona in 1700</strong>. Sixty dwellings have been identified, as well as streets, wells, sewers and other infrastructure. And the large number of items that have been recovered, including kitchen utensils, pieces of glass and porcelain, work tools, weapons and so on, mean it is now possible to faithfully reconstruct the everyday life of Barcelona&#8217;s populace in the 17th and early 18th centuries.</p>
<p>The Born Cultural Centre was opened in 2013 and, as well as the archaeological site, it is a venue for exhibitions, displays, talks, concerts, shows and other events.</p>
<p>Beyond its doors is one of most dynamic and picturesque neighbourhoods in Barcelona. People who have lived there all their lives rub shoulders with travellers passing through, hundred-year-old shops with restaurants offering contemporary cuisine, and medieval mansions with design studios. So the archaeological site shares the neighbourhood with the new trends that characterise it today.</p>

<p>The Museu Picasso de Barcelona houses 4,249 works in the permanent collection and is fundamental if you want to get to know the painter&#8217;s youthful and formative years. The museum occupies <strong>five palaces in Carrer Montcada </strong>that constitute one of the best examples of civil Catalan Gothic architecture. They have a common structure, around an internal courtyard and a grand external staircase which grants access to them. In fact, the whole of Carrer Montcada is classified as a <strong>historical and artistic monument</strong>.</p>
<p>The Museu Picasso symbolises the love affair between the city of Barcelona and the painter. The <strong>Ruiz Picasso family</strong> came to Barcelona at the end of the 19th century, when Pablo was only 14.14 Immediately he started studying at the <strong>Escola de Belles Arts de la Llotja</strong> fine arts academy and began his career as a painter. 18 When he was 18, he experienced the opening of the <strong>Quatre Gats cafe</strong>, which became one of the Catalan intellectual centres of that time. The young Picasso painted the cafe&#8217;s menus in exchange for holding an exhibition there.</p>
<h3>Picasso’s Barcelona</h3>
<p>The first years of Picasso&#8217;s training were fundamental to his artistic career, and he always kept his link with Barcelona. So much so that, by express wish of the artist, and thanks to the help of his secretary and friend Jaume Sabartés, it was decided that the city should permanently house a museum of <strong>his work as a young man</strong>. Pablo Picasso himself donated the series <em>Las Meninas de Velázquez</em> to the museum, one of his best-known and most important works.</p>
<p>Carrer Montcada, a vestige of noble Barcelona from another time, was the place chosen for the museum, and the collection was established in the <strong>Gothic Aguilar palace</strong> in 1963. The subsequent increase in the picture collection led it to occupy, in different years, the Baró de Castellet, Meca and Finestres palaces, and the Casa Mauri.</p>
<p>The museum is in the <strong>La Ribera</strong> neighbourhood in the Ciutat Vella district, where the painter also had his <strong>first workshops</strong>. Very close to the Quatre Gats and La Llotja, there are settings that were crucial in Pablo Picasso&#8217;s artistic training and development.</p>
<p>The love affair between Barcelona and Picasso never ended. In Ciutat Vella he left friends, relationships and drawings, and, by his own choice, one of the best museums of his work.</p>

Two years later the Museu Marès opened.</p>,"<h3>An exceptional building</h3>
<p>Very close to the cathedral, the Museu Marès is housed in part of the <strong>Palau Reial Major</strong>, which had been the residence of the counts of Barcelona and the kings of the Crown of Aragon and Catalonia in the Middle Ages, a Gothic building of enormous historical value and great beauty.</p>
<p>The Grand Royal Palace embraces a delightful inner <strong>courtyard surrounded by archways</strong> and full of orange trees, the <em>verger</em>, or orchard. It is open to the public and during the months of good weather it is a peaceful meeting point, undisturbed by the noise and bustle outside. In the middle of the courtyard is a fountain where, during Corpus Christi, an egg dances in the L&#8217;ou com balla celebration.</p>
<h3>The Marès universe</h3>
<p>It is definitely worth going in and taking time to discover the secrets of the Museu Frederic Marès, because it is <strong>packed with items</strong> of every kind. Visitors can admire magnificent wooden Romanesque polychrome sculptures, but there are fans, old pharmacist&#8217;s jars, pipes, toys and lots more too. Such was the universe of Frederic Marès, the sculptor who devoted a large part of his life bringing together Hispanic sculptures and objects in a collection of great value.</p>
<p>The most notable works of art include a <strong>portrait of the Roman emperor Augustus</strong>, from imperial Tàrraco (Tarragona), and an extensive series of <strong>polychrome religious </strong>figures dating from the 12th to the 18th centuries.</p>
<p>Among the <strong>everyday objects</strong>, arranged in ten themed rooms, the collection of women&#8217;s items (clothing, accessories, jewellery, etc.) stands out, as does the photography room and the collection of wrought iron, ranging from medieval keys to strong boxes. Frederic Marès never lost his <strong>passion for collecting</strong>, so the museum continued to expand and be enriched by new items. The lack of space meant work had to be carried out to enlarge it in the 1960s and again at the end of the 20th century. While this work was taking place, a part of the <strong>Roman wall</strong> was discovered, including one of the towers.</p>

<p>Making use of the natural slope of a mountain to create an <strong>open-air stage </strong>with optimal acoustic conditions was a process used in classical Greek civilisation. And in Barcelona, you have the chance to enjoy a theatre with these very characteristics. The Grec, in <strong>Parc de Montjuïc</strong>, was opened as an outdoor theatre and one of the most spectacular places on the mountain. Although it might seem like it, it is not a relic left by the Ancient Greeks, but rather a construction that was painstakingly designed and built in 1929 for the Barcelona International Exposition. The architects who came up with the idea were Ramon&nbsp;Reventós&nbsp;and Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, who made use of an old disused quarry to create a theatre inspired by the&nbsp; Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus, in Peloponnese, in which the carved stone wall serves as a stage.</p>
<p>Major <strong>classical works </strong>have been performed here, although due to the Spanish Civil War it almost fell into disuse. In 1976, with the opening of the <strong>Grec</strong> Festival, it was given a new lease of life and since then, it sleeps in winter and awakens each summer to become the central venue of the city&#8217;s biggest performing arts festival. The Grec is the venue where the festival of the same name opens each year and it hosts all kinds of musical and theatrical shows.</p>
<h3>The theatre gardens</h3>
<p>Its <strong>stunning gardens </strong>are also worth a visit. Surrounding the theatre with trees, shrubs, plants and flowers, and formerly known as the Rosaleda d’Amargós Gardens, they were restored in 2008 by Patrizia Falcone, who gave them back their early 20th century appearance, when they were designed by the French architect <strong>Jean-Claude Forestier</strong>. At the entrance to the gardens, which are accessible from Passeig de Santa Madrona, there is a stone stairway that takes visitors up both sides of the wall. The geometry of the flower beds, the pergolas, the ponds, the creepers, bursting with colour, the orange trees and the multiple flowers on the rectangular terrace, create a dreamlike space which is a perfect place to take a break.</p>

<p>Barcelona Zoo has always been very popular throughout its <strong>120 years</strong>. As an aside, it is worth mentioning that admission was free in the early days, although animal auctions and egg sales were organised to fund its maintenance.</p>
<p>Back then the zoo had lots of exotic animals, such as dromedaries, ostriches and an elephant. The latter, a female called Júlia, became the real star because, at that time, elephants were almost unknown to the people of the city.</p>
<p>The misery and hunger of the Civil War and post-war years meant many animals died, including the famous Júlia, and that in turn led to the zoo&#8217;s decline. Despite that, the economic recovery of subsequent decades led to an increase in the number of species and the facilities were improved. Since then, Barcelona Zoo has grown in every sense and become a <strong>European benchmark</strong>.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the zoo has gone from being a place for exhibiting animals to a <strong>research, study and education centre</strong>. Today it has modern facilities and looks after the welfare of the animals, which now number more than 2,000. Among the many facilities some stand out, like the primate gallery, the Komodo dragon facility, the palm grove with its aviaries and the dolphin pavilion.</p>
<h3>In memory of Snowflake</h3>
<p>Barcelona Zoo was home to an <strong>albino </strong>gorilla, the only one ever found in the world, which lived from 1966 to 2003. <strong>Snowflake</strong> was the undisputed star of the zoo, and his death was grieved by everyone in Barcelona. Although he has many descendants, no other white gorilla has been born, which has led to a call for one to be cloned. This is scientifically possible as the zoo has preserved samples of his ADN.</p>

Designed by the architect <strong>Josep Lluís Sert</strong>, a close friend of Miró, it was conceived as an <strong>open space</strong> with indoor and outdoor terraces that allow visitors to circulate freely.</p>
<h3>The legacy of a painting genius</h3>
<p>The origins of the Miró Foundation date back to 1968, when the painter held his first <strong>big exhibition</strong> in Barcelona, which was at the old Hospital de la Santa Creu. After that, the cultural society of the time saw the need to create a space that could exhibit <strong>Miró&#8217;s work</strong> in the way it deserved. In line with the artist&#8217;s wishes, it was built as a space that would exhibit not only his work but also <strong>contemporary art</strong> in all its different facets.</p>
<p>The Miró Foundation was Barcelona&#8217;s first contemporary art museum. It marked a break and a turn to the avant-garde that it maintains today, as the depository of the works Miró gave to Barcelona and as a <strong>centre for popularising </strong>contemporary art.</p>

<p>The former <strong>bullring</strong> in Plaça Espanya, Les Arenes, is today one of the most important and popular shopping centres in the city, both for the locals and tourists.

<p>Apart from bullfighting, the ring has witnessed <strong>a number of difficult circumstances</strong> in the course of Barcelona&#8217;s history, being converted into barracks for the republican side during the <strong>Civil War</strong>. It later became the setting for boxing, circus and festivals. In the 1940s and 50s it was equipped with a <strong>detachable velodrome</strong> to enable cycling events to be held, at a time when <strong>competitive sports</strong> started to become fashionable in Catalan society.</p>
<h3>Privileged views</h3>
<p>The last bullfight was held in 1977 with the bullfighter José Manuel Dominguín, among others. The ring then fell into disuse until<strong> 2007</strong> when the decision was made to convert it into a shopping centre. Curiously, the architects Richard Rogers and Alfonso Balaguer decided to maintain<strong>the old facade</strong> and add a roof in the shape of a dome, from where <strong>the best views of Barcelona can be seen</strong>.</p>

<p> Built by the architect Lluís Abellán Aynés and opened in 1929 as part of the <strong>Barcelona International Exposition</strong>,at that time is played host to five of the most important matches of La Liga, and was up and running until 1955, when the <strong>Mediterranean Games </strong>were held.Following these Games, the stadium experienced a period of decline and it was not until 1992, with the Barcelona Olympics, that the team of architects comprised of Vittorio Gregotti, Frederic Correa, Alfons Milà, Joan Margarit and Carles&amp; Buxadé completely remodelled the stadium. Leaving the exterior facade intact, new stands were built inside the stadium, giving it a total capacity of <strong>54,000 spectators.</strong></p>
<h3>Top level sport</h3>
<p>It has been classified by UEFA as a <strong>five star stadium</strong>, which means it can host top level international sports competitions. In 2010 it hosted the <strong>European Athletic Championships, </strong>for which it was once again remodelled, and currently, both visitors and locals consider it to be, along with Camp Nou, one of the city&#8217;s key sports facilities. It was named after the president of the Generalitat during the Civil War, <strong>Lluís Companys</strong>,who was executed by firing squad at Montjuïc Castle,close to the site of the stadium.</p>

<p>The creation of this museum was a long-held dream that finally came true. In 1953, writer and art critic <strong>Alexandre Cirici</strong> created the Associació d’Artistes Actuals (Association of Contemporary Artists) with the aim of bringing <strong>contemporary art </strong>together in a single space, as had already been done at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the famous MOMA. However, it was not until 1987 that this idea became a reality when architect <strong>Richard Meier</strong> was commissioned to build a unique building in which to house it.</p>
<p>The MACBA is located in the Raval neighbourhood, in <strong>Plaça dels Àngels</strong>, a bright, light space measuring some 14,000 square metres, which was the first step in the process of redeveloping the area. Meier&#8217;s <strong>modern and rationalist </strong>architecture, with a very light building, made from glass, metal and reflective elements, contrasts with the placidness and Gothic sobriety of the <strong>Convent dels Àngels</strong>, one of the buildings integrated into the MACBA which hosts exhibitions, and the Alexandre Cirici Document Centre, with a collection of more than 64,000 documents.</p>
<h3>Contemporary art</h3>
<p>The MACBA collection, which includes <strong>5,500 works </strong>by different artists, offers a journey through art from the abstract art of the mid 20th century, through European pop art and the new avant-garde, up to the present day. The collection includes works by distinguished <strong>local artists</strong>, such as Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies, Joan Brossa, Joan Ponç, the Dau al Set collective, Josep Maria Subirachs, Jaume Plensa and the Mallorcan artist Miquel Barceló. It also has work by <strong>national and international artists</strong>, particularly South Americans and artists from Eastern countries, including works from distinguished artists such as the Equipo Crónica collective, Jorge Oteiza, Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol, Gordon Matta-Clark and Jean-Michel Basquiat, among many others.</p>
<p>The MACBA forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, which aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage. Alongside this initiative, the MACBA celebrated the 25th anniversary of the mural produced by <strong>Keith Haring</strong> in 1989, as part of the fight against AIDS, by restoring it.</p>

<p>The Fabra Observatory is one of the oldest still-active observatories in the world. Its long history has permitted systematic and continuous study of the local <strong>climate</strong>, <strong>seismic activity </strong>in the area, and <strong>astronomy</strong>. It was formally inaugurated in 1904 in the presence of King Alfonso XIII, and belongs to the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona. Its name comes from Camil Fabra i Fontanills, Marquis of Alella, an industrialist and politician from Barcelona who donated a large sum of money for a project that was initially only to cover two areas: astronomy and meteorology.</p>
<p>The Observatory has received several awards including the Narcís Monturiol Plaque conferred by the Generalitat (regional government) of Catalonia, and the Gold Medal of the City of Barcelona granted by the City Council</p>
<p>In 2014 the European Physical Society (EPS) designated the Fabra Observatory as an EPS Historic Site. This honour recognises the Observatory’s discovery of an atmosphere on Titan&nbsp;(in addition to a number of other discoveries), and its centenary series of (meteorological and seismic) observations. The Fabra Observatory is the first centre in Spain to receive this distinction from the EPS.</p>
<h3>Under the stars</h3>
<p>The tours organised by the Fabra Observatory are an unforgettable experience, as they include direct observations of the <strong>Moon, Jupiter, Saturn </strong>or<strong> Mars</strong>, according to the time of year, as well as various other heavenly bodies, and even the possibility of dinner under the stars. The observations are made just as they were a century ago, namely with the giant <strong>refracting telescope </strong>that dates from 1904.</p>
<p>When entering or leaving the observatory, visitors make another wonderful discovery: a short <strong>botanical route </strong>around the gardens that surround it, where you can see pines, firs, cypresses, holm oaks and box trees, mimosa, laurels and mastic, as well as many other species.</p>

This is what Arts Santa Mònica seeks to do: escape constraints, generate spaces for meeting and exchange and make room for the most daring and innovative in artistic expression<strong>.</strong> Hence its incorporation of work from such disciplines as literature, science, philosophy, architecture, fashion and cuisine. It is a fusion of all the elements that provide the <i>raison d&#8217;être </i>for Centre de la Creativitat which the Arts Santa Mònica has become. Arts Santa Mònica is part of the Raval Cultural project, a collection of over three hundred cultural offerings from the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The square where the Mirador de Colom tower is located is called <strong>Portal de la Pau</strong>, and it is a memorial to the end of the Second World War, but the fame of the explorer&#8217;s statue is so great that the square has lost its real name: everyone knows it as Plaça Colom.</p>

<p>At the end of the 19th century, Robert Robert i Surís, the Marquis of Robert and a highly influential aristocrat of the time from Girona, commissioned the construction of his main residence in what was then one of the most privileged parts of Barcelona the corner of <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> and Avinguda Diagonal. Built between 1898 and 1903, Palau Robert was designed by <strong>the French architect Henri Grandpierre</strong> and built with <strong>stone from Montgrí</strong> by the Catalan architect Joan Martorell. It stands out for its <strong>Neoclassical architecture</strong>, not at all like the prevailing Modernisme, which was spreading throughout the Eixample.</p>
<p>The Palau Robert garden was designed by the <strong>municipal gardener Ramon Oliva</strong>,who would later be in charge of designing the Plaça Catalunya gardens.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>On the death of the marquis in 1929, the Robert family tried to sell the mansion. After the <strong>Civil War</strong> a company was set up to convert it into a hotel with an entertainment room but this never came off. Finally, in the 1980s, it became the property of the regional government, the <strong>Generalitat de Catalunya</strong>.</p>
<p>Having been used for various functions throughout its history, at the end of the 1990s it opened as the <strong>cultural centre</strong> we know today. The building also houses a <strong>tourist information centre.</strong> Its <strong>well-kept garden</strong> is open to the public and receives lots of visits from both tourists and locals.</p>

<p>As a starting point for the fruitful association between Eusebi Güell and the architect Antoni Gaudí, Palau Güell was the first important project that the artist carried out for the industrial tycoon. Built between 1886 and 1888, it is a wonderful example of Modernista architecture for residential use, with the combination of functionality and innovative design that Gaudí used to apply to his work.</p>
<p>The building is situated on Carrer <strong>Nou</strong><strong> de la Rambla</strong>, one of the most emblematic in the Raval neighbourhood. The choice of location is unusual, as a large proportion of the bourgeoisie were setting up home in the new Eixample. So the building stands out like a unique jewel and a rare bird among the smaller, more simple houses in the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Oriental and naturalist inspirations</h3>
<p>In the midst of his Orientalist period, Gaudí took his inspiration for this mansion from Islamic art, particularly Mudejar and Nazarite. This is the reason for the abundance of ceramic tiles, mitre arches and pinnacles in the shape of pavilions or domes. It is also considered to be one of the first <strong>Art</strong><strong> Nouveau</strong> buildings in the world, due to its stylised plant-like and organic shapes, inspired by nature. The building also plays masterfully with the concepts of light, space and volume. </p>
<p> It is worth noting too that it was the first time Gaudí used trencadís, the mosaic finish made from irregular pieces of broken tiles, that was later to become a hallmark of his work. Also, the mansion&#8217;s chimneys, each one different from the rest, serve to represent the ornamental concept that the architect would later apply to other projects such as La Pedrera and Casa Batlló. </p>
<p> Declared a Historical Artistic Monument by the Spanish government in 1969 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, Palau Güell is a building of great beauty that should be visited by anyone who wants to understand the work of Gaudí as a whole. It also forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, an initiative that aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>In 1329, the <strong>mariners&#8217; guilds</strong> in La Ribera placed, on their own initiative, the first stone of what is considered the only entirely finished <strong>Catalan Gothic</strong> building: the church of Santa Maria del Mar. 55 years later, in 1383, and without the work being interrupted once, the doors of this great church opened. A temple which, through the years, and thanks to the success of Ildefonso Falcones&#8217;s novel, has come to be known as The Cathedral of the Sea.</p>
<p>Santa Maria del Mar is emblematic and unique, with <strong>three great naves</strong> of almost the same height, and columns every thirteen metres, a distance that was never exceeded in any medieval building.13 The whole building gives the <strong>sensation of being light </strong>and airy, spacious, and there is a notable lack of ornamentation. There are no ogival arches or filigree, and the flying buttresses are delicate. It is pure Catalan Gothic art. Only the light that filters through the stained glass windows adorns this basilica.</p>
<h3>Surprising and inspirational</h3>
<p>To go through the doors of Santa Maria del Mar is to find yourself amid the grandeur of the church, a <strong>marvel of construction</strong>. So much so, that according to reports, it was here that Antoni Gaudí was inspired to create the Sagrada Família.</p>
<p>Today, Santa Maria del Mar, nestling among the narrow streets of El Gòtic, surprises visitors as they turn the corner. The serenity that it transmits makes you think about the harbour porters, and the humility of the sea workers that managed to put up this cathedral in the middle of a sand pit.</p>

<p>Barcelona Cathedral has been contemplating the city throughout eight centuries of history. In the 13th century <strong>King Jaume II, the Just</strong>, decided to construct a temple over the remains of an earlier Romanesque church. The work, funded by the fraternities and guilds, took more than 150 years, but never interrupted the religious services.</p>
<p>These days, the Catedral de Barcelona is one of the best examples of Gothic art in the city. Every day thousands of visitors take photos of the impressive 70 m high, <strong>Neo-Gothic façade</strong>. But the cathedral steps take you into a whole new world to be discovered. More than <strong>215 rib vault keystones</strong> in the interior give you and idea of the cathedral&#8217;s grandeur. Inside you also find the <strong>crypt of Santa Eulàlia</strong>, 29 dedicated chapels and a high altar above which there is an impressive Gothic stained glass window. For the most keen-eyed, the best test is to find the hockey game carved into the choir stalls.</p>
<h3>Secrets to discover</h3>
<p>But the cathedral also hides secrets you cannot appreciate at first glance. On the roofs and pinnacles there are <strong>200 gargoyles</strong> keeping watch from on high, but it is surprising to find a bull, a unicorn and an elephant among the monsters and demonic beings.</p>
<p>Before leaving the lofty reaches, the temple&#8217;s bells deserve a special mention. Of the <strong>21 bells</strong> in the cathedral, all with women&#8217;s names, the most remarkable is the rebellious <strong>Honorata</strong>. In 1714, during the War of Succession, Philip V &#8220;imprisoned&#8221; and melted down this bell in retaliation for it ringing to call the citizens to revolt.</p>
<p>The cathedral&#8217;s surprises go beyond its architecture. The garden, where you find the <strong>cloister</strong>, is guarded by the <strong>thirteen white geese</strong> of Santa Eulàlia, one for each of the agonies she suffered, as well as for the years of her life. There is also a fountain, where an egg dances on the flowing water at Corpus Christi, a typical Barcelona tradition.</p>
<p>The passage of time has only increased the majesty of the cathedral, guardian and guide to the city, and from its terraces it blesses the entire municipality of Barcelona at 9 am on 3 May each year for the feast of Santa Creu.</p>

<p>A visit to the museum is a journey through the history of this <strong>ancient civilisation</strong> and enables you to see some imposing works, including a statue of <strong>Ramesses III</strong>,<strong> mummies</strong> and hundreds of other <strong>items</strong>: jewellery, funeral steles, domestic utensils, portraits and so on. Thanks to the Clos Archaeological Foundation, the museum also publishes material and offers a master&#8217;s in Egyptology, as well as organising temporary exhibitions, children&#8217;s activities, research projects and even expeditions to Egypt.</p>
<h3>Fascination with Egypt</h3>
<p>The origin and history of the museum is closely linked to <strong>Jordi Clos Llombart</strong>, the chairman of a major hotel chain with a passion for Egypt. The starting point was an exhibition he organised in one of his hotels in 1992. It was so well received by the general public that he decided to establish the Egyptian Museum of Barcelona a couple of years later. Subsequently, the increase in the size of the collection and the number of visitors allowed it to move to its <strong>current home</strong> on Carrer de València, in 1992. Since then, the collection, the number of visitors and the museum itself have not stopped growing.</p>

<p>There are buildings that invite you to take a look through the various artistic movements that have influenced the city, and the Church of El Remei is one such. Built in a <strong>mixture of</strong> <strong>different styles</strong>,hereyou can find a Neo-Romanesque doorway, a Neo-Gothic rosette and even a Neo-Classical cornice. The most historicist and, probably, most striking element is the bell tower, which was built by <strong>Antoni Rovira i Rabassa</strong> in 1897 and is crowned by an <strong>iron dome</strong> from which the bells hang. </p>
<h3>Local identity</h3>
<p>The building stands in iconic <strong>Plaça de la Concòrdia</strong>, which is one of the district’s liveliest squares and one that, along with the church itself, evokes a time when <strong>Les Corts</strong> was an independent township from the city of Barcelona.</p>
<p>The church was designed by <strong>Josep Oriol Mestres i Esplugues</strong> between 1846 and 1849 and remains the principal place of worship in the neighbourhood to this day. The Feast (“<strong><em>festa major</em></strong>”) of La Mare de Déu del Remei, or Our Lady of Remedy, <strong>patron saint of Les Corts</strong> and one of the most venerated manifestations of Our Lady in Catalonia, takes place in early October, when the streets are decorated ready for these celebrations. </p>

<p>Casa Batlló, pure <strong>Modernista fantasy</strong>, is the work of the architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, a symbol of a period and a very specific social class: Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie at the start of the 20th century. It was a time when, thanks to the implementation of the <strong>Cerdà Plan</strong> that had started at the end of the 19th century, many well-off families moved to <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> and also established their businesses there. One businessman who did just that was <strong>Josep Batlló i Casanovas</strong>, who, in 1903, acquired the original building on the site and a year later, in 1904, hired Antoni Gaudí, already very famous, to remodel it.</p>
<h3>A life of its own</h3>
<p>What the architect did was a turning point in modern architecture and left an <strong>artistic legacy</strong> for posterity. By applying his <strong>naturalistic ideas</strong>, with undulating and organic shapes, and creating a new facade totally clad in <strong>stone and glass</strong>, and inspired by coral, he gave the building a completely new and original appearance.</p>
<p>At the same time, Gaudí&#8217;s main aim was always functionality, so it is worth noting the attention he paid to the lighting and the ventilation. He introduced a <strong>large interior courtyard</strong> that the service rooms looked out onto, while the salons and bedrooms were on the side of the facade.</p>
<p>Even today Casa Batlló is seen as an original and daring work, something that gives it incalculable value and led to it being declared a <strong>World Heritage site by UNESCO</strong>.</p>

<p>But it was not until <strong>1929</strong> that it was officially opened as the Cafè de l’Òpera and remodelled in the Modernista style that it still preserves today. Restored by the architect Antoni de Moragas, the café remains <strong>one of the most elegant places in Barcelona</strong>.</p>

<p>The Ros family sold sixteen and a half hectares of land to the <strong>Congrés Eucarístic Housing Trust</strong>, to be used to build workers’ housing on, on the condition that the farmhouse&#8217;s perimeter area would be respected.

The urbanisation permit was denied as it failed to comply with Ildefons Cerdà’s town plan. These three streets finally opened up in the early 20th century, when a group of industrialists and financiers settled in the area to build summer homes, which later would become full-time homes. The neighbourhood began to grow from that moment on, with the arrival of traders, liberal professionals and, above all, labourers, who came to work in the local factories and workshops. These newcomers were especially large in number in Carrer Garcilaso, between Carrer Matanzas, Carrer Puerto Príncipe and Carrer Francesc Tàrrega.

The property fell into the hands of Barcelona&#8217;s Dominican friars of Santa Caterina. This was probable the result of a donation from an individual’s will, though there are no dated documented records for that. The friars had been living in a house in Carrer del Call since 1221 and subsequently moved to the convent of the same name at the spot the Saint Caterina market stands on today, where they stayed until the ecclesiastical confiscations of 1835.  Santiago Güell i López &#8211; Baron and President of the Spanish Olympic Committee &#8211; became the owner of the house in the 20th century. He gave the house its present appearance. A restaurant with gardens designed by Nicolau M. Rubió i Tudurí was built in a piece of land separated from the property in the late 1920s. It includes a mine of water, as well as the fountain called Font del Lleó.  Only the exterior is currently open to visits.</p>

They achieved that in 1836, although the building that housed the town hall had to wait until 1884 . The old town hall, now the district headquarters of Les Corts, was designed by Antoni Rovira. It is a Neoclassical building, crowned by a pediment with the Les Corts coat of arms. It contains several Neoclassical elements, notable among which, in its noble rooms, is a collection of paintings by Antonio M. Fabrés. In front of the building, there is a statue of Pau Farinetes, an iconic Les Corts resident from Mas Farinetes.

It was opened towards the end of the 1920s ,for the 1929 International Exposition, since when, it became a fast road that separated the social centres on either side. Covering it helped to connect the people and the neighbourhoods.  This new distribution encouraged the development of a whole series of urban structures that give this new avenue its own personality. Its street lights, which are unique in the entire city, are the most obvious. Several sculptures were put up in the area, many of them fountains.</p>

Colonia Castells was the largest private initiative of the time and a model for subsequent projects. This neighbourhood pattern consists of five small streets made of 30 m2 houses, inhabited by five or six people. The state of the buildings, constructed with many defects, has made it necessary to apply a study for the reorganisation and redevelopment of the area, which opens up a a public green area of around 10,000 square metres. Therefore, in February 2018, the District initiated a participative process, with the aim of defining the proposals and criteria needed for the drafting of an executive project for reorganising this new space. During the community process, the discussion included how to preserve the area&#8217;s historic memory; the activities that would take place and the future uses for the area, as well as the relationships that would be established with the services surrounding the block. The decidim.barcelona website contains all the information, campaigns and questions relating to the project.</p>

Sarrià was a rural town in the middle of the 19th century. Agriculture was tied to powerful landowners and the remaining nobility. Change here was the direct result of social unrest rather than the industrial revolution. This square witnessed many key events in Catalan history, including the fall of General Espartero. It was during the revolt against this strongman that a member of one of Sarrià&#8217;s most influential families died: the pharmacist Margenat. The house on the corner of Carrer Major de Sarrià still bears his name.    The square used to be full of stands selling meat and other produce and hold a dairy from a cow pen in Pedralbes, until the market was built. Elderly residents still remember the long-gone bar and men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s toilets there used to be nearby a medical clinic.   The popular revolts were gradually replaced with antique fairs, second-hand book sellers and food stalls.

In 1908, the tunnel was reused for the first electric passenger train built in Spain. The one-car train, with room for 36 passengers, travelled through a tunnel decorated with dozens of coloured lights, and was a great success with Barcelonians keen to enjoy nature and visit the Collserola mountains. By the time this short-lived line stopped operating, it had transported close to 40,000 passengers.

Carrer de Jordà was renamed when the village of les Corts was annexed to Barcelona, taking the name of Morales in honour of the mayor of the time.  The surrounding architecture is based on the typical one-storey-house structure intended for the workers who moved to Barcelona from all over Catalonia to work in the many factories that were continuously being set up in the district between the late 19th and the early 20th centuries.

Since 1909, it has been one of the sites for the <em>festa major</em> (summer fête): firstly, because one of the traditional marquees was erected here and, now, as a decorated street. <br />A bit further down, you will come to Plaça de Gato Pérez, commemorating the place where the Argentine singer-songwriter, an adopted son of Gràcia, met the gypsies of Gràcia at the Penya Curro Romero. With its close links to the <em>festa major</em>, this is where he discovered the Catalan rumba. Gato Pérez made rumba the focus of his musical activity, and this became the high point of his career in terms of prestige and fame. The surface of the square is composed of three different types of paving, describing the outline of a guitar: red cobblestones, pieces of granite and prefabricated concrete tiles.</p>

Work began in 1928 under the supervision of architect Josep Alemany. The building was later expropriated by the Franco regime and reopened in 1941, under Falangist management. The cooperative was finally dissolved in 1950, following its merger with the La Flor de Maig cooperative. </p>
<p>Over time, the building would come to house a turró (almond nougat bar) factory on its ground floor, as well as the Bahia festival hall on the first floor, which became a musical landmark in the Barcelona of the 1950s and 1960s. It later became a discotheque and finally closed down in 1988. The turró factory was also closed years later, at the start of the 21st century.

<p>Like so many other convents in Barcelona, for example, Sant Josep and Santa Caterina, which once stood on sites today occupied by markets that have adopted their names, the Capuchin convent was destroyed during the confiscation and sale of Church lands in the 19th century. A large, rectangular <strong>porticoed square</strong>, surrounded by Neoclassical buildings, was built on the vacant site between 1848 and 1859. Following the design of the <strong>Plaza Mayor</strong> in Madrid the architect, Molina, conceived a neat, elegant square that would have a portico with a Catalan vault, supported by a semicircular arch, and Isabelline facades with Corinthian pilasters and balconies.</p>
<p>Plaça Reial is just a stone&#8217;s throw from the <strong>Liceu</strong> opera house, the ultimate symbol of bourgeois Barcelona, and for many years it was the nerve centre of the city&#8217;s business powers.</p>
<h3>Meeting point</h3>
<p>Today the haughty character of times gone by has given way to a more popular feel and the square has become one of the busiest in Barcelona. Its terraces offer locals and tourists who pass through the chance to take a pleasant break for a drink or a bite to eat, while the archways shelter bars, clubs and concert halls.</p>
<p>The square conceals a few other treasures too: the two <strong>street lamps with six arms</strong> are the work of a young Antoni Gaudí, while the cast-iron Fountain of the Three Graces is by Antoni Rovira i Trias and dates from 1876. And last but not least, on Carrer del Vidre is the oldest herbalist&#8217;s in Barcelona and probably in the whole of Catalonia: the <strong>Herboristeria del Rei</strong>, a shop that has remained immune to the passage of time for almost two centuries.</p>

It was <strong>formerly an agricultural</strong> estate with a residential mansion, and in addition to its location in an idyllic corner of Barcelona, it is also steeped in history.</p>
<p>The origin of the estate dates back to the 17th century, when the Horta-Guinardó district was predominantly rural and the <strong>Can Gausachs farmhouse </strong>was built. It remained as it was until the property was bought in the 18th century by the <strong>Milà de la Roca family</strong>,who turned the farmhouse into a <strong>French-style manor house</strong> in the early 19th century. However, it wasn’t until the middle of the 19th century that the next owner, <strong>Lluís Martí Codolar</strong>, and his family filled the gardens with exotic animals, giving rise to <strong>Barcelona’s first zoo</strong>.</p>
<h3>An eclectic environment</h3>
<p>The Granja Vella was transferred to the <strong>Congregation of the Salesians </strong>in 1946 because of the <strong>close</strong> <strong>friendship </strong>that <strong>Lluís Martí Codolar</strong> had developed with <strong>Joan Bosco</strong>, which he extended to the Salesians of Sarrià. Granja Vella de Martí Codolar’s rural setting, religious mysticism and <strong>stately elegance </strong>are a subtle, <strong>harmonious</strong> combination that continues to inspire awe to this day.</p>

<p>The old La Maternitat <strong>hospital complex</strong> in the <strong>Les Corts</strong> district is very close to Camp Nou. Nowadays, this <strong>Modernista complex</strong>, formed by a number of pavilions, not only serves as a <strong>hospital </strong>but is also home to other institutions such as the <strong>Archives of the Provincial Council of Barcelona</strong>, the <strong>National University of Distance Education</strong>, a primary healthcare centre, a school, etc. Highlights include the buildings of the <strong>blue pavilion </strong>and the <strong>pink pavilion</strong>. Its biggest attraction, which delight both locals and visitors alike, are the <strong>gardens open</strong> to the public, which merge nature with architecture in a unique way. Features include the statue <strong><em>La maternitat</em></strong>, by sculptor Lluïsa Granero.</p>
<p> Built on the <strong>Can Cavaller</strong> estate in the late 19th century, the initial project for the structure of the complex and the pavilions, most of which are Modernista in style, was entrusted to <strong>Camil Oliveres i Cansaran</strong>, at the time the <strong>Provincial Council architect</strong>, who distributed the buildings throughout the space in accordance with the most advanced healthcare standards of the day. Following his death, the project was taken on by other architects. The buildings are made from exposed brick and decorated with <strong>polychrome ceramics </strong>in a synthesis of aesthetics and functionality typical of this architectural style.</p>
<h3>Solidarity and care for the disadvantaged</h3>
<p>The history of this complex is of great <strong>social and architectural value</strong>, as its aim was to provide care and assistance to the <strong>most disadvantaged people </strong>of that era: abandoned children and &#8220;secret&#8221; mothers. Because of the aims of the institution, the gardens were designed to try to make the sick people&#8217;s stay as pleasant as possible so, today, visitors are able to enjoy the numerous species of trees found in the park, such as the tall date palms and what is probably the <strong>tallest magnolia tree in Barcelona</strong>, measuring more than twelve metres tall and fifteen metres wide. La Maternitat is a <strong>historical site </strong>that is full of charm where visitors can relax and observe the comings and goings of the neighbourhood from beneath the shade of the trees.</p>

<p>Documented since 966, this church suffered destruction by Al Mansud (985) and the Almoravids (1115) in the Middle Ages. It was rebuilt in the 16th century, when the chapel was called Capella dels Segadors, the starting point of the Catalan Revolt, where peasants held flags of the Holy Christ of the parish during the Corpus de Sang riot of 1640. Expansion work started in 1846, but then it was decided to rebuild it. The architect Pere Falqués i Urpí (1850-1916), from Sant Andreu himself, designed the building. In 1882 the dome collapsed in the middle of a mass, causing several deaths and injuries. The work was finished by Josep Domènech i Estapà (1858-1917). The bell tower was completed in 1889 and the façade was finished in 1904. Tragic Week took place in Barcelona between 26 July and 1 August 1909. Social tension in Barcelona and the discontent of the masses with official and religious institutions formed into a rebellion, caused by the calling up of reserve troops to go fight in the Second Rif War. The first protests led to a general strike. A state of war was declared in the province of Barcelona and the strike became a violent insurrection. In relation to the Parish Church of Sant Andreu de Palomar, the rector refused to let them play their marches. During Tragic Week (1909), rebels set the main altar, organ and wooden altars in the church on fire. A pile of pews, confessionals and other objects was made in the middle of the dome, which burned for 30 hours. One of the biggest losses of Tragic Week was the Crist dels Segadors, a crucifix raised during the revolt in 1640. During the Spanish Civil War, the place of worship was burned again by a group from the Iberian Anarchist Federation, and the dome suffered an attempted bombing. The air forces of the Spanish Republic used the church for storing petrol and the bells were melted to make war material.</p>
<p>The library museum unveiled by Father Joan Clapés in 1901 for the Diada de Sant Andreu (local holiday) was also lost. Between 1956 and 1960, the painter Josep Ver-daguer i Coma (1923-2008), from Sant Andreu himself, decorated the place of worship with large murals repre¬senting biblical scenes and the life of Saint Andrew</p>

<h3>The engineer Ramon Perera</h3>
<p>Barcelona was bombed by the <strong>German and Italian air forces </strong>during the Spanish Civil War. As a result, the Generalitat&#8217;s <strong>Junta</strong> <strong>de Defensa Passiva </strong>(Passive Defence Committee) commissioned the engineer <strong>Ramon Perera</strong> with designing a system that would enable to the population to take shelter from the attacks. Perera proposed the construction of underground shelters that could be accessed by steps from a block of flats or the street.</p>
<p>They were constructions crowned with exposed-brick <strong>Catalan vaults</strong> to resist the force of the bombs and with zigzag entrances to protect them from the blast waves. This was an advanced design for <strong>passive defence </strong>which proved effective because, according to historians, there are no records of fatalities in these shelters.</p>
<h3>Other shelters</h3>
<p>Barcelona has numerous shelters that can be visited and which allow us to discover what life was like for the city&#8217;s residents during the Civil War. Many used to shelter in <strong>metro and train</strong> stations and corridors too, such as the one at the <strong>Plaça de la Universitat</strong> station.</p>

<p>La Lira is a <strong>cultural and sports association</strong> founded in 1870, that has strong ties with the Sant Andreu neighbourhood. The underground air-raid shelter beneath <strong>Carrer de Coroleu</strong> was probably used by members of the board of directors to continue their meetings in a safe setting while the city was being bombed during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>It remained unnoticed for years and there were doubts over whether it was used as a shelter or cold storage room, although there is a <strong>plan of shelter 469 </strong>on the same street, showing <strong>similar features</strong>.</p>
<h3>Unregistered shelters</h3>
<p>A small bomb shelter with only one access point can be found under the Societat Coral La Lira. Therefore, it does not comply with the regulations set out by the Passive Defence Board regarding the number of access points for public shelters, which required two or more of them to prevent people from being trapped inside in the case of collapse. Two staircases lead up to a narrow gallery, leading eventually to a circular room with a domed ceiling. The room has a round stone table and circular bench going around it. There is a small water tank and three openings in the wall, probably used as storage space. Can be visited.</p>

<p>Can Culleretes was a success story from the day the first owner began to serve meals. She was the doorkeeper of a nearby convent, outside the walls, close to Plaça de Sant Jaume. This lady began to serve her drinks and meals through a window. She produced a home-made <i>mató</i>, a kind of cottage cheese, that was said to be delicious. It was a resounding success: she left the her position at the convent to open a restaurant in Carrer d’en Quintana. There are many stories about where the name originated: some people say it comes from the fact that it was the first place to use metal spoons, but others claim it was the cry of the waiter continually shouting for spoons to serve the ten diners who just fit inside the restaurant.</p>

A notable feature is the <strong>hopscotch</strong> mosaic unveiled in 1997, during Gràcia&#8217;s annual festival<i>,</i> which is like a route through the traditional images of the <i>festa major</i>.</p>
<h3>Air-raid shelter</h3>
<p>When the square was remodelled in 1995, an <strong>air-raid shelter from the Spanish Civil War</strong> was discovered there, hidden away in the subsoil. Only a small area of its infirmary remains, which can be accessed from the fourth floor of the car park.</p>

It is also known as <strong><i>Plaça dels Tres Senyors</i></strong>, the square of the three owners of the rural lands surrounding it when Gràcia was still a village: Messrs Torrente, Masens and Rabassa.

<h3>A prolific architect</h3>
<p>Rovira i Trias, a resident of Gràcia, was the architect of <strong>many of Barcelona&#8217;s markets</strong>, among other things, such as the Born, Concepció, Sant Antoni and Barceloneta markets. He was also responsible for <strong>planning the town, Vila</strong> de Gràcia, packed with narrow streets and numerous squares. Hence the square&#8217;s memorial to him, a life-size <strong>bronze sculpture</strong>. At his feet, you can see a map with his design for the Eixample, which won the public competition organised by the City Council in 1859 but finally lost to another project, which Madrid imposed, designed by the urban planner Ildefons Cerdà.</p>

<p>The small, semi-covered passage takes its name from the stockbroker <strong>Josep Mallofré i Trius</strong>, who bought an old barracks that was being used as a garage for a transport company&#8217;s vehicles. After knocking down the existing buildings, he built <strong>three new houses</strong>: one on Carrer Major de Sarrià, another on Clos de Sant Francesc and a third one in the interior, so that they formed a passage that could be used as a shortcut between the two main streets.</p>

On top of that, it is very close to the house where the poet, journalist and essayist <strong>Josep Vicenç Foix i Mas </strong>(1893-1987) was born. He was one of the most outstanding figures of the Catalan avant-garde. And his family&#8217;s famous patisserie Foix de Sarrià, founded in 1866, is at Nº 57 Carrer Major de Sarrià.</p>

<p>On the corner of Anglesola and Doctor Ibáñez streets is the Cristalleries Planell glassworks building, built in 1913 according to a design by Josep Graner.The main façade, which is listed, has decorative elements that come from Catalan modernism made with the <strong><i>trencadís</i></strong> <strong>mosaic technique</strong>.</p>
<h3>Artistic glass works</h3>
<p>The Cristalleries Planell glassworks business was set up by <strong>Leopoldo Planell i Porqueras</strong>, the son of a working-class family. Here they made a wide range of glass objects, including jugs, various kinds of glasses, and small furnishings, even lamps that were exported to America.</p>
<p>It is one of the most important remnants bearing witness to the manufacturing past of Les Corts, and it had an influence on the <strong>growth of neighbourhood.</strong>Over time, it became one of the most important art glass factories in Europe, right up to when it closed in 1957, four years after the death of its founder.</p>
<p>In <strong>1925</strong>, Cristalleries Planell was also the setting for what is known as the “<strong>children&#8217;s strike</strong>”, a strike instigated by <strong>Francesc Pedra</strong>, who was only 11 years old, in which the children working at Cristalleries <strong>rebelled against the abuse and exploitation</strong> they suffered.</p>
<h3>An innovative architectural project</h3>
<p>The renovation project was run by Harquitectes, and led by Josep Ricart. An innovative project that helps to optimise energy consumption. Two of the site&#8217;s three sides were defined by the former factory&#8217;s listed façade. The building consists of four floors that back away from the southern heritage façade. The resulting covered courtyard makes it possible to reconcile construction and heritage and improve natural-light conditions in the classroom areas, while also providing a thermal and acoustic cushion from the surrounding area.<br />
The building&#8217;s cross-section explains its conduct: the control and management of air in natural conditions. The features that move this air are completely natural, based on the use of solar chimneys and covers, creating breezes. Lastly, in order to improve light conditions in the courtyards and to give the façade a material connected to the memory of Cristalleries Planell, a solid block of glass was introduced as part of the wall fittings, making it possible to bring natural light to the northern courtyard and improve light in the southern courtyard.</p>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie at the close of the 19th century liked to have opulent buildings built for them on Passeig de Gràcia, to show off their power. The Casas-Carbó were no exception: the stone facade, with detailed sculpture work, the bay windows on the main floor and the elegance of the whole building were an unequivocal <strong>declaration of intent</strong>.</p>
<h3>Treasures hidden inside</h3>
<p>The main floor preserves part of the original decoration, with wrought-iron and ceramic features, and a magnificent sculpted fireplace, created by the decorator Josep Pascó. This floor leads to the terrace, with the chance to enjoy one of the most spectacular <strong>interior courtyards </strong>in the Eixample: from here you can admire the rear facade of the Pedrera, which is in the same block of houses. For years the building has housed <strong>Vinçon</strong>, a shop selling designer furniture and household goods.</p>

<p>The Sarret bakery has never stopped making and selling bread in over a century, although it <strong>has changed hands a few times</strong>. The current owners restored the name of the family who opened it, Sarret, as a tribute to the craft bakers of that time. These days they sell a wide range of bread, cakes and pastries.</p>

<p>Listed as a Cultural Asset of Local Interest (BCIL) and an eloquent example of Sant Andreu de Palomar&#8217;s rural past, this three-storey farmhouse with a <strong>neoclassical facade</strong> was built between 1650 and 1651, at the height of the Guerra dels Segadors, or Reapers&#8217; War. A 17th century manor house renovated in the early 19th century. The terracotta figures on the top of the main façade, which give the building its name, as well as the porticoed side galleries and the large balconies, come from the renovation work in 1825. In the garden we find a valuable ornamental fountain, work of Josep Puig i Cadafalch. It has recently recovered the shield with four bars that had been removed at the beginning of the Franco regime. The property was looked after by the <strong>Feliubadaló family</strong> from its origins to 1900. When they left the farmhouse, a canning factory moved in and used it until it was bought by the industrialist Valentí Iglesias.</p>
<h3>From farmhouse to outdoor school</h3>
<p>Les Carasses became a school during the Second Spanish Republic, in 1931. It was a coeducational school based on <strong>outdoor education</strong> and contact with nature.

<p>Two of these three buildings, known as Jaume I and Roger de Llúria, owe their origin to the <strong>military barracks </strong>constructed in 1887. The third, the <strong>Dipòsit de les Aigües</strong>, had been built some years before and inaugurated in 1880 to regulate the flow of water to the waterfall in Ciutadella park and irrigate the gardens. Designed by architect <strong>Josep Fontserè </strong>the construction is identical to a Roman prototype, comprising a maze of <strong>14-metre-high </strong>parallel arches, which intersect in a barrel vault and spread out with a mirror effect along its 65 metres. <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, then a young architecture student, contributed to the project by doing the calculations for the support elements. Today, transformed into the <strong>UPF&#8217;s General Library</strong>, the Dipòsit de les Aigües offers impressive reading rooms where students can consult the entire <strong>catalogue</strong>, and which includes, among other things, the collections from the Haas Library, Barcelona&#8217;s Chamber of Commerce, and the Jaume Vicens Vives University Institute of History, which is also located in this building.</p>

The path of the wall continues towards the sea, with some sections revealed, others being unearthed, and yet others hidden by buildings, until it reaches Plaça dels Traginers, where another imposing tower can be found. From there the wall continued to the sea gate, <strong>Porta del Mar</strong>, the remains of which can currently be seen inside the Pati Llimona Civic Centre Outside and backing onto the walls is where the dockside Roman baths were built.

<p>On a little over 200 hectares of what used to be industrial sites there are now more than <strong>1,500 companies</strong> linked to the media, IT, energy, design and scientific research. Poblenou&#8217;s <strong>industrial land</strong> was the setting for Barcelona&#8217;s industrialisation and these days it is home to a <strong>knowledge cluster</strong>. But the future has not fallen out with the past, and lots of new companies are housed in <strong>old factories</strong> and Modernista-style industrial complexes. So, the old textile mill Ca l’Aranyó is now the Pompeu Fabra University&#8217;s <strong>Communication Campus</strong>, while the fabric warehouse Can Munné today houses the <strong>Bau design school</strong>.</p>
<h3>Change in design</h3>
<p>Model restorations like <strong>Palo Alto</strong>, an old industrial site that currently houses the studios of artists and creators, such as the designer <strong>Javier Mariscal</strong>, live side by side with the most contemporary architecture. Examples of this are the <strong>Torre Agbar</strong>, designed by the architect Jean Nouvel, and the <strong>Barcelona Growth Centre </strong>building, by the architect Enric Ruiz Geli, a cube with four different faces that has received the highest awards for energy efficiency, sustainability and design.</p>
<p>But restored or new-build, the buildings of 22@ have become <strong>city icons</strong> and turned an industrial neighbourhood into a <strong>laboratory for constant innovation</strong>. Tradition serves progress and the old factories have been redesigned to achieve greater sustainability. Poblenou is living through a new golden age of industry, the age of knowledge.</p>

Originally, this plot of land was part of the enormous <strong>Güell family</strong> estate, and today, in addition to this &#8220;palace&#8221;, there is also a historically very important garden Due to their proximity to the university facilities, these gardens are particularly the haunt of students.</p>
<p>Since last year, the inside of the palace has been used as a venue for the <strong>Festival de Música Jardins de Pedralbes</strong>, one of the most important in the city.</p>
<p>Another emblematic green area in Zona Universitària is Parc de Cervantes, designed by Lluís Ruidor i Carol in the 1960s, an area which contains more than <strong>10,000 rose bushes</strong>, including <strong>220 different varieties</strong>, and wide paths to stroll down or run along, or places simply to sit in and enjoy the peace and quiet.</p>

<p>At 512 m above sea level, Tibidabo is the highest point in the <strong>Collserola range</strong>. Today it is one of the places in the city&#8217;s <strong>historical memory</strong> but it was not until the end of the 19th century that people of Barcelona discovered this mountain next to the city that opened the way to the <strong>green lung</strong> that is Collserola. Until then it had been a bandit&#8217;s lair and pasture for goats.</p>
<p>Plans to develop Avinguda del Tibidabo, with <strong>mansions and stately homes</strong>, also included building an amusement park and a church. So, in 1912, when the park was already up and running, the <strong>Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor</strong> was built, a Neo-Gothic style church reminiscent of the Sacré Coeur in Montmartre, Paris. The upper part of the church is 575 m above sea level and offers some of the <strong>best views</strong> of anywhere in Barcelona. On a clear day it is possible to see the peaks on the island of Mallorca.</p>
<h3>Close to the sky</h3>
<p>Such a high point proved ideal for building an <strong>astronomic observatory</strong>, <strong>the Observatori Fabra</strong> ,which is the fourth oldest in the world and still working. In the summer months, so you can feel a bit closer to the sky, the observatory organises <strong>thematic stargazing suppers</strong>.</p>
<p>Another unmissable part of Tibidabo is the <strong>amusement park</strong>, one of the oldest in Europe and still going strong. It was built at the start of the 20th century and immediately became one of the favourite leisure haunts of Barcelona people. The house of mirrors, the unique views of the city from Talaia, L&#8217;Avió the plane from 1928, and the <strong>fairground machine museum</strong>, offer fun for young and old alike and form part of the city&#8217;s memory.</p>

<p>Vila de Gràcia is one of the most charismatic neighbourhoods in the city. It still preserves the small, narrow streets of a <strong>rural community</strong>, built round the fast-flowing <strong>streams</strong> that used to pass through it, while its inhabitants proclaim they are proud of being part of Gràcia and of their Gràcia spirit, revived every summer at one of Barcelona&#8217;s most popular <strong>festivals</strong>. Vila de Gràcia is a pleasure to walk round and admire. Highly creative shops can be found on every street, while <strong>terrace culture</strong> has taken root in <strong>every square</strong>, of which there are many. Any time of day or night is good to pause, sit at one of these terraces and watch life pass by in Gràcia.</p>
<h3>Past and present</h3>
<p>Until the 17th century, this neighbourhood was nothing more than a few, <strong>isolated farmhouses</strong>, three convents and the odd villa that the wealthy built as summer houses. But with the dawn of the 19th century came <strong>industrialisation</strong> and Gràcia became important, as it had land that was available for factories to be built on. That was when Gràcia demanded its <strong>independence</strong>, which it achieved three times: in 1821, 1828 and 1849. Vila de Gràcia was finally swallowed up by Barcelona in 1897 but before this a major road had been built that would link the centre of Barcelona with this rapidly expanding town: <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong>, which made use of the old road that joined the two urban centres.</p>
<p>But industrialisation was not the only thing going on in Vila de Gràcia. For more than two centuries, the <strong>Gypsy community</strong> that had settled round <strong>Plaça del Raspall </strong>had been handling the livestock. A wealthy Gypsy community who, like the Gràcia locals, organised their life round its streets and squares. A cradle that mixed <strong>flamenco rhythms</strong> with Cuban sounds and salsa, brought here by immigrants from the Americas. The result: <strong>Catalan rumba</strong>, a typically Gràcia style of music.</p>
<h3>From square to square</h3>
<p>Gràcia has many faces. <strong>Modernista</strong> Gràcia, which saw the first buildings built by the architect Antoni Gaudí, such as <strong>Casa Vicenç</strong>, on the edge of <strong>Plaça Lesseps</strong>; the Gràcia of iconic squares, such as <strong>Plaça de la Virreina</strong>, <strong>Plaça del Diamant</strong>, which Mercè Rodoreda turned into a novel, <strong>Plaça del Sol</strong>, with its multiculturalism, and <strong>Plaça de la Revolució</strong>, republican and liberal; the Gypsy Gràcia of Catalan rumba and the Gràcia of <strong>independent theatres</strong>, such as the Lliure; the Gràcia capable of mixing local residents with the most Bohemian modernity of the <strong>artists</strong> who set up their workshops there. Fun is strolling round Gràcia, exploring a world of <strong>curious shops</strong>, full of new crafts, old and modern designs, amusing yourself in stately homes, enjoying fresh air in the squares or watching <strong>art house films</strong>. Day or night. There is always something going on in Gràcia.</p>

<p>The Barcelona of wealthy businessmen at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th unfolds in Eixample&#8217;s famous Quadrat d’Or, the Golden Square with its <strong>gems of Modernista architecture</strong>. Bordered by Carrer Aribau and Passeig de Sant Joan, by Avinguda Diagonal at the top and Plaça de Catalunya at the bottom, its main artery is the famous <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong>, an avenue of leisure for the well off at the start of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The demolition of the walls that were suffocating the old Barcelona in 1863, marked the beginning of its expansion and the new Eixample district, designed by the town planner Ildefons Cerdà. Wealthy families moved to this new neighbourhood, giving rise to an <strong>almost fantastical landscape</strong>, as you can see by taking a walk round its streets.</p>
<p>The Quadrat d’Or takes us back to that time when bourgeois families competed to have the most luxurious and extravagant house, and the most renowned architects of the day, such as <strong>Antoni Gaudí, Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong> competed to build it. This competition gave rise to marvels in the form of Modernista buildings with a refined style and impressive facades, not holding back with ceramics and other materials like wrought iron, wood and glass. Every facade has multicoloured stained glass, with flowers and intricate patterns, large windows in organic shapes, and majestic doors.

<p>When in 1898 the Spanish monarch lost the <strong>Cuban War </strong>and the former colony seized independence, many Catalans who had gone to the Americas came home and built houses that reflected the fortunes they had made across the sea. Some of these entrepreneurs chose to take up residence in the hitherto unpopulated land in the <strong>Sant Andreu district. </strong>It did not take long for the area to get the name Els Indians. Some houses are preserved from that time, among which the most notable is probably the one known as <strong>Torre Rosa</strong>, from 1920, now a cocktail bar.</p>
<h3>The Eucharistic Congress</h3>
<p>In 1952, in a post-war time when society was impoverished and immigration was increasing, the 35th <strong>International Eucharistic Congress </strong>was held in Barcelona, bringing together a large number of religious leaders from around the world. One of the results of this event was the decision to build various estates for the families of the workers, among which the El Congrés neighbourhood was the most important.</p>
<p>The Congrés Eucharístic Housing Trust bought 16.3 hectares of the old <strong>Can Ros</strong> estate belonging to the Ros and Ramis families, where it planned the new neighbourhood under a housing model boasting a generous area that offered two facades to ensure ventilation and which included green areas. A short time afterwards, this zone became annexed to the neighbouring area of Els Indians, making it the neighbourhood of contrasts it is today.</p>

<p>The renovated and modernise.<strong>Plaça d’Orfila was, for nearly a thousand years, the <strong>main square </strong>for the then independent town of Sant Andreu de Palomar, right up until this municipality was annexed to the city of Barcelona in 1897. Up to that point it had been known as <strong>Plaça de la Constitució </strong>or Plaça de l<strong>&#8216;</strong>Església, but joining the city meant a name change. In 1907 it was rechristened with its current name, in honour of the <strong>Menorcan doctor </strong>Josep Orfila i Rotger.</p>
<p>As the old centre of the town, the square houses the old town hall, now the <strong>district offices</strong>, and is presided over by the <strong>parish church of Sant Andreu de Palomar</strong>, a Neoclassical building begun in 1850 and finished in 1904. It sits on the site of an older, Gothic and Baroque temple, where previously there had been a 10th century Romanesque church.</p>
<h3>A square with memories</h3>
<p>Right at the end of the <strong>10th century </strong>the square became the scene of events that went down in the history books -it was sacked by the Muslims, led by the fearsome Almansor. It also had an important role to play in 1640, when it was the meeting point for Els Segadors (the Reapers) who revolted on May 22, taking as their symbol the <strong>Sant Crist dels Segadors </strong>from a chapel in the Sant Andreu church. The result of the revolution was the so-called <strong>Corpus de Sang </strong>(Corpus Christi of Blood), which signified the beginning of the G<strong>uerra dels Segadors </strong>-the Reapers&#8217; War.</p>
<p>Today, ready for the 21st century but without losing the charm of a <strong>town square</strong>, Plaça d’Orfila is the best place to get to know the history of Sant Andreu de Palomar and set off on a walk around the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The district used to be a <strong>rural area</strong> with <em>masies</em>, farmhouses, dotted here and there. There used to be one on the slopes of Turó de la Peira, bordering on Horta, known as <strong>Can Peguera</strong>, that made glue with the resin from the <strong>many pine trees</strong> that grew on its land.</p>
<p>Urban development only reached the area at the start of the 20th century, first in the form of some Modernista residences for wealthy families, of which the odd one still survives, and then the more <strong>humble dwellings</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1929, with the intention of <strong>housing the workers</strong> arriving in Barcelona to work on the International Exposition and build the metro, the Municipal Housing Board bought the old farmhouse land, which belonged to the Marquis of Castellbell&#8217;s estate, and drew up plans to build four blocks of <strong>houses</strong> there.</p>
<p>The terraced dwellings, with a little garden at the front and simple roofs, were named after the governor, although they were soon dubbed the <strong>cheap houses</strong> of Ramon Albó.</p>
<h3>Workers&#8217; houses</h3>
<p>The cheap houses were finished in 1931 and formed a <strong>series of blocks</strong> with 534 houses in all. A further 116 were built in 1947 and in 1949 the first <strong>blocks of flats</strong> were raised, one of them on the site left by the demolition of the old Can Peguera farmhouse.</p>
<p>At that time the Municipal Housing Board also built similar houses for workers&#8217; families in districts such as Sants-Montjuïc and Sant Andreu, but as the years passed these were replaced by blocks of multi-storey flats. Can Peguera, on the other hand, has survived as a <strong>testimony to the past</strong>, maintaining its unique, working-class character.</p>

During the <strong>shelling of Barcelona</strong> ordered by General Espartero on 3 December 1842, Lesseps intervened directly on behalf of the city, and that earned him Barcelona&#8217;s recognition.</p>
<h3>Everyone&#8217;s square</h3>
<p>In 2005 work began on remodelling the square, to facilitate the flow of traffic without being detrimental to the <strong>life of the neighbourhood</strong>. After lots of negotiations, plans were agreed that met a good number of both the goals set and the residents&#8217; requests, which included leaving the <strong>facades of adjacent buildings</strong> visible, equipping the square with <strong>passable spaces</strong> for pedestrians and softening the acoustic impact of traffic.</p>

The historical centre of Vilapicina also includes the <strong>Ca n’Artés farmhouse</strong>,which was a travellers&#8217; inn during the 14th and 15th centuries, owned by the monk and art enthusiast Pere d’Artés.Today the house is in a perilous state but it still preserves some <strong>original medieval features</strong>, such as the door with a round arch in the middle of the facade and one of the windows with a pointed arch.</p>
<p>A stroll through this piece of history in the present-day district of Nou Barris, contemplating the <strong>rural remains</strong> of places that no longer exist, encourages you to travel back to a distant past that still survives today.</p>

<p>Gràcia is a neighbourhood filled with tiny streets and squares, and <strong>Plaça del Diamant</strong> is one of its oldest and most emblematic ones. Located in what was formerly known as the<strong> jewellers neighbourhood</strong>, Plaça del Diamant owes its name to the Gràcia town councillor, <strong>Josep Rosell i Imbert</strong>, who engaged in the trade of precious stones. When he designed this plot in 1850, he came up with the idea of giving the streets and squares that still exist the <strong>names of precious stones</strong>: Carrer de la Perla (Pearl), Or (Gold) and Topaci (Topaz).</p>
<h3>Literature and memory</h3>
<p>Engraved in the popular memory by the <strong>famous novel</strong> <em>La plaça del Diamant</em> by <strong>Mercè Rodoreda</strong>, and its subsequent adaptation as a film by <strong>Francesc Betriu</strong> in 1980, in this <strong>delightful nook </strong>in the city one can still sit on a bench and listen to the birds singing and the children playing in the square. As a tribute to the novel, a sculpture of <strong><em>La Colometa</em> </strong>by the artist<strong> Xavier Medina-Campeny</strong> was installed in 1984, depicting the main character with her doves.</p>
<p>The symbology of the square took an unexpected turn in 1992, when the <strong>air-raid shelter</strong> beneath the square was discovered during the execution of road works. Built twelve metres below ground level by the residents of the neighbourhood during the <strong>Spanish Civil War</strong>, it gave shelter to more than two hundred people during the many air-raid attacks launched on the <strong>industrial district of Gràcia </strong>of that time, with its many factories that were the main target of the attacking aircraft. This shelter was one of the more than 90 in the neighbourhood, and it is one of the largest of the 1,300 that were built in Barcelona, one of the first cities bombarded systematically from the air in a war. Today, with the objective of recovering the area&#8217;s historical memory, the History Workshop of Gràcia arranges <strong>guided tours</strong> to explore the site and it is well worth visiting the shelter and seeing its tunnels which saved the lives of so many people.</p>

<p>The streets making up the <strong>shopping centre</strong> of this area deserve a special mention. Carrer de Lisboa, Carrer del Tajo, Baixada de la Plana and Carrer de Dante make up an enchanting group of shops offering good <strong>quality produce</strong> at reasonable prices.

<p>If you had to describe Sant Andreu&#8217;s character in two words, they would be <strong>tradition and struggle</strong>. And in the middle, <strong>the residents</strong>. Sant Andreu has residents, but the century-old associations, local shops, an active social life, and people greeting each other on the streets are what make it a real neighbourhood. It still has traces of the village it used to be and which is still very much alive in <strong>Plaça Orfila</strong> and the historical centre, full of intimate little side streets and century-old shops, like those you can find on Carrer <strong>Gran de Sant Andreu</strong>.<br />
But Sant Andreu conceals a lot more treasures. Some, even though you cannot see them, are documented and date back to <strong>Roman times</strong>. Like the remains of the aqueduct that served the Rec Comtal, the large canal that used to carry water across Barcelona. Others, which you can see, such as the <strong>Can Carasses</strong> <em>masia </em>or farmhouse, today the Escola Ignasi Iglésias school, speak of Sant Andreu&#8217;s agricultural past when it was tasked with supplying Barcelona, in the 17th century.</p>
<p>And yet more, treasures that describe the great industrial past of the 18th century, like the <strong>Fabra i Coats spinning mill</strong> that has now been reclaimed, after a long struggle by local residents, providing 30,000 square metres for public use including the Fabra i Coats-Creation, the Centre Cultural Can Fabra, the local library Biblioteca Ignasi Iglésias, the neighbourhood centre Casal de Barri de Sant Andreu, the Espai social i cultural Josep Bota and Plaça de Can Fabra. <strong>Modernisme</strong> also left its mark in Sant Andreu, with properties such as Can Guardiola, today providing office space for non-profit associations, and Can Vidal, as did <strong>rationalism</strong>, with a gem of contemporary architecture, Casa Bloc, commissioned by Catalonia&#8217;s republican government in 1932 and who invited architects from all round the world to study the structure.</p>
<h3>Festivals and traditions</h3>
<p>Sant Andreu is a neighbourhood that has held on to its traditions and turned its festivals into unmissable events for everyone. It is the first Barcelona neighbourhood to hold the annual <strong>Tres Tombs festival</strong>, with its blessing of pets and domestic animals. For this a <strong>procession</strong> sets off from Plaça Orfila with ox-drawn <strong>carts</strong> and horse-drawn <strong>carriages</strong>, whose occupants throw tonnes of sweets to the watching public.</p>
<p>And from sweets to blunderbusses, <em>trabucs </em>in Catalan, because there is another kind of procession, a <em>cercavila</em>, that fills Sant Andreu&#8217;s residents with pride. And that is the <strong>Esclat Andreuenc</strong>, where a group of <strong><em>trabucaires</em></strong>wake up the neighbourhood by firing off salvoes with their guns. Sant Andreu is the past, but it is also the <strong>present</strong> and the <strong>future</strong> that the associations and proud local residents are committed to maintaining.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of El Clot is a place for a leisurely stroll, with your hands in your pockets and your <strong>eyes peeled</strong>. The impressive Torre Agbar, 144 m of steel, glass, light and colour, makes you lift your gaze skywards to see where it ends. But now this tower, which altered Barcelona&#8217;s skyline, has a companion that is set to become a global benchmark for design, namely <strong>Disseny Hub Barcelona</strong>, the work of the MBM team of architects: Josep Martorell, Oriol Bohigas and David Mackay. The building is a cantilevered parallelepiped, the same width as the street, and it has become a reference for contemporary architecture. It has the <strong>highest sustainability rating</strong> a building can get and houses a museum, the <strong>Museu del Disseny</strong> de Barcelona, with a collection of over 70,000 items.</p>
<p>Yet in El Clot there is also time for a <strong>relaxing walk</strong> round the parks and other places with more charm. Despite the train lines and the main thoroughfares of Avinguda de la <strong>Meridiana</strong> and <strong>Gran Via</strong>, there are some spots worth a visit that take you back to a charming rural and industrial past. The <strong>Farinera del Clot</strong>, one of the biggest flour mills in Catalonia, is in this neighbourhood. Now this Modernista-style former industrial site is an ICT-driven <strong>cultural centre</strong>.</p>
<h3>Places to discover</h3>
<p>El Clot still has lots of alleyways, <strong>little streets</strong> running between two broader ones, that speak of a past of gardens and vegetable patches. <strong>Passatge de Robacols</strong>, (cabbage stealer passage) for example, where a row of little white houses seem to be caught in a time warp, or the <strong>Torre del Fang</strong> (mud tower), an old farmhouse that has been preserved. In the heart of the neighbourhood, <strong>Plaça del Mercat</strong> still displays the same commercial vitality that made the market, a pretty Modernista construction, the place to go for fruit and vegetables in Barcelona. Not far away, the <strong>Caixa de Pensions i Mont de Pietat</strong> building, still operating, makes us look up to its semicircular dome, and then it is time to look for the frogs hiding under an umbrella in a <strong>Modernista mosaic</strong> of the old J. Budesca umbrella shop. Scraps of the old city are still kept alive at the popular <strong>Mercat dels Encants</strong>, a Fira de Bellcaire or flea market where you can find virtually everything, in the style of the French Marché aux Puces.</p>
<p><strong>Parc del Clot</strong> is the place to rest and enjoy nature in this neighbourhood. A big green space on the site of the train company Renfe&#8217;s old mechanical workshops that has kept the <strong>factory chimney stack</strong> and the old facade, now turned into <strong>an aqueduct with a waterfall</strong>.</p>

<p>At the start of the 20th century, Poblenou was known as the &#8220;Catalan Manchester&#8221; and now it could become the &#8220;Silicon Valley of Barcelona&#8221;. The workers are changing but its <strong>hardworking</strong> character remains.</p>
<p>Poblenou, a neighbourhood on the Sant Martí <strong>seaboard</strong>, has seen how the physiognomy of its streets has changed without losing their essence. Cheap, available land close to Barcelona, and water in abundance, led to factories being built and the growth of a very powerful <strong>industrial district</strong>. There were factories of every kind: textile mills such as Ca l’Aranyó (today the home of <strong>Pompeu Fabra University</strong>), and Can Felipa (now a civic centre), engineering plants like Can Girona (of which the chimney has been preserved), flour mills, tanneries, chocolate factories, and liqueur distilleries. These <strong>factories</strong> and their <strong>chimneys</strong>, over 30 of which are still dotted round the neighbourhood, competed for space with the houses hurriedly built for the workers and even the shantytown that grew up on the beach, round <strong>Somorrostro</strong>, where the great flamenco <em>bailaora</em> Carmen Amaya was born. You can easily trace the historical footprints that have been left by walking round the old, still narrow streets, while the more adventurous can take a tour of the <strong>cemetery</strong>, the first in the city, where it is possible to see the old Neoclassical and Modernista mausoleums.</p>
<h3>A new character for new times</h3>
<p>The <strong>1992 Barcelona Olympics</strong> opened the city up to the sea and gave the whole area a new character. The traditional industries gradually disappeared and the neighbourhood was transformed. It still retains its working-class character but what it produces has changed a lot. In the same factory buildings, examples of early 20th century <strong>industrial architecture</strong>, overalls have been replaced by sneakers in a landscape of <strong>technology companies, design and universities</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rambla del Poblenou</strong>, where Carmen Amaya danced her first steps and anarchists fought for better wages, where you can find century-old shops and other establishments, today has an air of <strong>calm and tradition</strong> without forgetting those roots. <strong>Tío Che</strong> makes sure of that. A cafe that used to sell the popular tiger-nut drink <strong><em>orxata</em></strong>to exhausted workers as they came out of the factories now sells it to young creators in their sandals and jeans, who have turned the Catalan Manchester into the Silicon Valley of Barcelona.</p>

<p>Entering the Gothic Quarter is to make for Barcelona&#8217;s origins, the place where two thousand years ago the Romans founded <strong>Bàrcino</strong>. Today, we can follow the traces of that Roman city thanks to preserved fragments of the walls that encompass a perimeter which still marks the typical layout of a Roman town. The <em>cardo</em>, located along today&#8217;s Carrer Llibreteria, the <em>decumanus</em> along Carrer Ciutat and the Forum, where Plaça Sant Jaume is today, in the centre. Very close to this square, going up Carrer Paradís to the doorway of the ramblers&#8217; club, the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya, you can find a millstone that signals the highest point of <strong>Mont Tàber</strong>, a hill rising 16 m above sea level and, inside, hidden in the patio of this Gothic building, four columns are preserved from the <strong>Roman temple</strong> that stood at this point.</p>
<p>Roman Bàrcino was transformed into Medieval Barcelona, and at the hand of the counts and kings it became one of the most splendid cities in Christian Europe. The Jews who settled in Barcelona clustered around <strong>El Call</strong>, a network of narrow, chaotic streets with a multitude of houses, among which we can still find vestiges of that time, like the <strong>main synagogue</strong>, one of the oldest in Europe and which can be recognised by the hole on the right-hand side of the lintel.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages brought with them commerce, the arts and the professions, the appearance of the sober Romanesque style in buildings like the <strong>Capella de Santa Llúcia</strong>, a chapel integrated into the Barcelona&#8217;s cathedral, and the Gothic explosion, with the cathedral being the prime example, as well as other numerous unique buildings. <strong>Plaça Sant Jaume</strong> became the home of the city council and since then it has been the seat of Barcelona&#8217;s main political institutions, the City Council and the Catalan Government, in the two imposing Gothic buildings that face each other across the square.</p>
<h3>Places with history</h3>
<p>The narrow streets and little squares of this neighbourhood invite you to wander around and let yourself be surprised by its charm and always lively atmosphere. There are many curious little corners, like <strong>Plaça Traginers</strong>, under one of the towers on the Roman walls; <strong>Plaça Sant Just</strong>, with the oldest medieval fountain in the city and an imposing Gothic church; and the Baroque <strong>Plaça Sant Felip Neri</strong>, with a central fountain that fills it with freshness.</p>
<p>Painters like Picasso, Casas, Novell and Russinyol have strolled through the Gothic Quarter looking for inspiration before entering the <strong>Quatre Gats cafe</strong>, on Carrer Montsió. Gaudí also walked here as he took his daily saunter to the church of Sant Felip Neri, as did the architect Domènech i Montaner on his way to find inspiration for the Palau de la Música. Thousands of visitors walk through the Barri Gòtic everyday, following in the footsteps of history.</p>

<p>A defiant blue building, the triangular <strong>Edifici Fòrum</strong>, welcomes you to a newly built neighbourhood that has given <strong>light and visibility</strong> to one of the most deserted and ignored parts of the city: the Fòrum, a neighbourhood developed around the first Universal Forum of Cultures in 2004.</p>
<p>In this <strong>new</strong> Sant Martí <strong>neighbourhood</strong>, <strong>leisure and culture</strong> have swallowed up formerly industrial land. Abandoned sites were turned into <strong>Parc del Fòrum</strong>, a complex that holds the city&#8217;s biggest events: <strong>mega music festivals</strong> such as Primavera Sound, the La Mercè festival concerts and the spectacular &#8220;Feria de Abril&#8221;. This is the ideal setting for these <strong>crowdpullers</strong>.</p>
<p>Parc del Fòrum includes the Edifici Fòrum, a spectacular triangular building, 25 m high, that houses the <strong>Museu Blau</strong>, Barcelona&#8217;s new national natural sciences museum; the <strong>Esplanade</strong>, the second biggest square in the world covering 84,000 square metres; the <strong>Parc dels Auditoris</strong>, a large outdoor space that combines two halls linked by a passageway; and the <strong>Zona de Banys</strong>, a bathing area with an unusual set of sea-water swimming pools. The park is an oasis of leisure activities and festivals, firmly committed to the environment and sustainability, with its huge 1,700 m <sup>2</sup> <strong>solar-panel</strong>.</p>
<h3>Future potential</h3>
<p>The Fòrum is on the edge of the <strong>Diagonal Mar</strong> neighbourhood and is one of the new areas of Barcelona with the most potential. The transformation from a rundown past to a highly <strong>skilled and technological</strong> future has completely revived the whole area. Siting Diagonal Mar, a <strong>huge shopping centre</strong>, there and opening it up to the sea by reclaiming the <strong>urban beaches</strong> and <strong>Parc Diagonal Mar</strong>, the work of architects Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue and consisting of a residential complex with skyscrapers, a large <strong>garden with a lake </strong>and a sports area, have made this part of the city the ideal place to see the Barcelona of the future: <strong>modern and sustainable</strong>, without forgetting its past.</p>

Today it is a magnificent residential area.</p>","<h3>The athletes’ neighbourhood</h3>
<p>The <strong>1992 Barcelona Olympic Games</strong> were responsible for various parts of the city being completely redeveloped. For example, the Olympic village, Vila Olímpica, was built in the middle of an <strong>industrial district</strong>, an old shantytown and a beach not worthy of the name. This <strong>newly constructed</strong> neighbourhood, with some truly iconic buildings, breathed new life into a rundown area. The <strong>design</strong>, produced by a team of architects consisting of Josep Martorell, Oriol Bohigas, David Mackay and Albert Puigdomènech, followed the grid model of the Eixample district&#8217;s housing islands.</p>
<p>Vila Olímpica was the <strong>official residence</strong> of the Barcelona &#8217;92 <strong>athletes</strong> but they gave way to families who gradually moved into the neighbourhood, which established itself as a <strong>benchmark for quality and tranquility</strong> in Barcelona. Wide roads, such as Avinguda Icària and Avinguda Bogatell, are bright and open, and invite people to take a stroll along them. The Olympic port, Port Olímpic, and Nova Icària have opened up the <strong>seafront</strong>. They have made Barcelona turn back towards the sea and enjoy it again, and by doing so, they have become one of the city&#8217;s top leisure spots.</p>
<h3>Facing the sea</h3>
<p>The <strong>twinned towers</strong>, Torre Mapfre and Hotel Arts, both over 154 m high, have changed the city&#8217;s skyline with their metal structures and welcome visitors to the new waterfront. Architect <strong>Frank Gehry&#8217;s</strong> <strong>Peix d’Or</strong> , an impressive bronze sculpture of a fish that changes colour with the time of day, is a reminder of the neighbourhood&#8217;s maritime past. Now lots of <strong>bars, <em>chiringuitos,</em> and restaurants</strong> congregate under its scales and have turned this into one of Barcelona&#8217;s most vibrant leisure areas.</p>
<p>The Vila Olímpica seafront also has a <strong>beach</strong>, <strong>Nova Icària</strong>, a tranquil haven for the people. Having a beach right next to the city, which you can get to by metro or bus, really is worth an Olympic medal.</p>

<p>La Sagrera&#8217;s <strong>origins</strong> are rather curious. It grew up on land around the churches that was <em>sagrat</em>, or sacred, and <strong>under the protection of the clergy</strong>. When it was a rural community, the farmers stored the harvest in the church silos, called <strong><em>sagrers</em></strong> because, being on a sacred site, they were protected from war and pillage. The <strong>popular, hard-working</strong> consciousness of the neighbourhood is something that has been maintained over the years.</p>
<p>Industrialisation brought factories to La Sagrera, like <strong>La Pegaso</strong>, which has now been turned into a municipal park, the long-gone <strong>Farinera l’Esperança</strong>, a flour mill, and the <strong>Ivanow</strong> paint factory which, after housing a number of different companies, is now the Nau Ivanow, an art and creation centre.</p>
<p>These are vestiges of an <strong>industrial era</strong> intimately linked to the growth of <strong>Avinguda Meridiana</strong>, the main road through the neighbourhood. 15 Its easily identifiable tall blocks of flats, some more than 15 storeys high, have become an icon of this <strong>entrance</strong> to Barcelona.</p>
<h3>Neighbourhood treasures</h3>
<p>Yet La Sagrera&#8217;s lovely little old quarter, tucked away behind the concrete tower blocks and centred round <strong>Plaça Masadas</strong>, is a peaceful haven that still maintains the tranquility of a family neighbourhood. <strong>Plaça de l’Assemblea de Catalunya</strong> and Parc dels <strong>Jardins d’Elx</strong> offer a green space <span style=""text-decoration: line-through"">s</span> open to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>As a <strong>multicultural</strong> and <strong>working-class</strong> neighbourhood, Poble-sec maintains a popular character and varied culture, and it is open to all those who want to go and take a look. Its main arteries are <strong>Carrer Blai</strong>, which is like a little &#8220;rambla&#8221; packed with bars and shops in equal measure, and <strong>Plaça del Sortidor</strong>, where a young Joan Manel Serrat used to play and now you can find the neighbourhood civic centre, which has been very active in recent years.</p>
<p>Poble-sec&#8217;s history dates back to the middle of the 19th century, when it was a basically rural area with vegetable plots and the hovels of farm labourers who worked in the shadow of Montjuïc&#8217;s lower slopes. Around 1850 families started to move there, mainly immigrants who could no longer squeeze into Raval, as noted at the time. Regarded as Barcelona&#8217;s first extension (<em>eixample</em>) before the Cerdà Plan was implemented, Poble-sec still retains the chaotic narrow streets that have so much charm.</p>
<p>Its name comes from the large number of <strong>textile mills</strong> that were set up there at the end of the 19th century. They consumed so much water that they left an area that had always had it in abundance dry (<em>sec</em>)</p>
<h3>Multicultural atmosphere</h3>
<p>Aside from this industrial activity, the fact it is behind Avinguda del Paral·lel means Poble-sec has always been linked to the <strong>world of entertainment</strong> as well. And the presence of emblematic theatres such as El Molino, the Apolo, the Condal and the Victòria, with their ample and varied <strong>cultural offering</strong>, has led to new types of <strong>cuisine</strong> appearing in the neighbourhood too.</p>

<p>The Sarrià neighbourhood still has the small-town air that so enthused the Catalan bourgeoisie in the 19th century: little streets and squares built around the high street, <strong>Carrer Major</strong>, narrow pavements on streets where neighbours greet one another as they pass by. Thanks to the craftsmen and middle classes who built their <strong>summer houses</strong> here, Sarrià became one of the most prosperous parts of Barcelona. The architecture reflects this splendour through the houses, many of them Modernista constructions, that can be found in the, on Passatge Mallofré or in Plaça Sant Vicenç.</p>
<h3>Sweet, poetic walks</h3>
<p>Near <strong>Plaça de Sarrià</strong> is Casa Orlandai , today the district&#8217;s <strong>civic centre</strong> and a Modernista gem, with interior decoration and stained glass windows that make it worth visiting and even a having a coffee in the interior terrace. Taking a stroll round Sarrià would not be the same without stopping to admire the mouth-watering window displays at the <strong>Foix cake shop</strong>, a veritable institution in the neighbourhood. With over 125 years of history behind it, this patisserie has sweetened the life of many Barcelona folk. The writer <strong>J. V. Foix</strong>, the son of its founder, swapped sweets for poems to become one of the leading literary lights of the Catalan arts. Moving from pastries to fried potatoes at <strong>Bar Tomàs</strong>, on Carrer Major, you can try what are considered to be the <strong>best <em>patates braves</em></strong>in the city.</p>
<p><strong>Sarrià</strong> was independent until 1921, when it was annexed by Barcelona. Despite that, it has retained its spirit of independent amid big Barcelona. Strolling round its <strong>squares and streets</strong>, pay attention to the houses and shops: they whisper the history of a small town that remains faithful to its essence.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Sants</strong> and <strong>Hostafrancs</strong> neighbourhoods, like <strong>La Bordeta</strong> next door, every day is a market day, so a morning stroll through their bustling streets is a real joy. They have always kept their <strong>authentic character</strong>, which is reflected in the energy of their residents, always active through the <strong>links between the official bodies</strong> of the three neighbourhoods and various <strong>cultural associations</strong>, such as the Centre Cívic de les Cotxeres de Sants, Can Batlló and the Casinet d’Hostafrancs.</p>
<p>Joined together by a long shopping street originally called <strong>Creu Coberta</strong> and subsequently Carrer de Sants, these neighbourhoods spread their domain through little side streets and squares that are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. Sants occupies the central part and its <strong>commercial life</strong> revolves round places like Plaça de Bonet i Muixí, the square with the Santa Maria dels Sants parish church, around which the first village in the area grew up. Its <strong>municipal market</strong> is really popular and in the emblematic little streets around it, such as Carrer de Sant Medir and Carrer de Sant Jordi, you can see and buy any item that might come into your head. There is a lot of activity round <strong>Barcelona Sants</strong> too, the city&#8217;s main <strong>railway station</strong>, which makes this one of the best connected neighbourhoods.</p>
<h3>Industrial past</h3>
<p>Hostafrancs developed after Sants in the middle of the 19th century and from the word go industry thrived there, especially the textile industry. This attracted a wave of people to the neighbourhood and gave it the <strong>commercial character</strong> that it maintains today.</p>
<p>Its <strong>daily market</strong> and many shops and businesses offer all kinds of quality products and services. Leaving the main shopping streets behind and exploring the neighbourhood&#8217;s hidden corners, you will find a web of little-known alleyways and low-built houses that evoke a village atmosphere in a city.</p>
<p>Sants and Hostafrancs also share one of the city&#8217;s most surprising green spaces, <strong>Parc de l’Espanya Industrial</strong>. This has transformed the old site of El Vapor Nou, a former cotton mill, into urban gardens with a lake in the middle and a 7 m high metal structure in the shape of a <strong>wild dragon</strong> which, as a slide, delights old and young alike.</p>

<p>Walking through Sant Pere i Santa Caterina, you find surprises around every corner. Roman remains, a reminder of the <strong>Rec Comtal</strong> irrigation canal, vestiges of the old textile guilds. These medieval neighbourhoods are open history books in the middle of the city. Crossing narrow streets and squares you come to <strong>Plaça de Sant Pere</strong>, where you can see the remains of the old Romanesque Benedictine convent, <strong>Sant Pere de les Puelles</strong>, which was the origin of the neighbourhood. This convent was one of the richest in Barcelona, as the Benedictines took in many of the daughters of the nobility who wanted to take their vows. The other part of the neighbourhood, Santa Caterina, also had religious beginnings, as it grew up around the <strong>Gothic convent</strong> of the Dominican Order. And from a nunnery, to a market. In 1848, a fire affected the convent, which was demolished. Its site became the location of the first covered market in an enclosure within the city: the Santa <strong>Caterina market</strong>, a Neoclassical construction, completely renovated in 2005 by the architect Enric Miralles, who designed the ceramic mosaic roof that has turned it into one of the neighbourhood&#8217;s iconic buildings.</p>
<h3>Yesterday’s names and today’s colours</h3>
<p>In the 18th century, the Santa Caterina and Sant Pere neighbourhoods became two important industrial centres, particularly for textile manufacturing. The street names are the best way to follow in these footsteps: rope makers, carders, blanket weavers, cotton makers, Plaça de la Llana (wool square), <strong>narrow winding streets</strong>, built along the ancient Roman roads where hundreds of factory houses clustered together to house the workers. Population pressure increased, and in 1835, in order to let a little air in, <strong>Carrer Princesa</strong> was opened, the first paved street in the city. But it was not until the 20th century that the whole area was reorganised with the building of <strong>Via Laietana</strong>, a wide avenue that divides the city&#8217;s historical centre into two, with Santa Caterina, Sant Pere and La Ribera on one side and El Gòtic on the other.</p>
<p>Santa Caterina and Sant Pere, two of the neighbourhoods in Ciutat Vella with the most personality, have now come back to life with a multitude of small restaurants, shops and bars, and the area is a mixture of multiculturalism and independent artists that attract visitors. Poets, painters, nobles and even thieves, like the bandit <strong>Joan de Serrallonga</strong>, have lived here. Strolling around here is to live the city&#8217;s history on the streets themselves.</p>

<p>The oldest building still preserved in El Raval is the <strong>Sant Pau del Camp</strong> monastery. It is Romanesque in style and originated in the 10th century when the area was outside Barcelona&#8217;s walls. But it in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhood was full of cultivated fields and convents, it too was protected, by the third city walls. Some important buildings, built in the Gothic style then prevailing in Barcelona, remain from that time. The imposing <strong>Drassanes</strong>, for example, the shipyards that mark the maritime edge of the neighbourhood, and the <strong>old Hospital de la Santa Creu</strong> building, now transformed into the national library, the Biblioteca Nacional de Catalunya, which has an internal courtyard full of orange trees that is open to everyone and invites you in to have a rest.</p>
<p>It was not until the 18th century that urban planning made this another of the city&#8217;s neighbourhoods, and immediately, thanks to the low rents, it became the home of workers and immigrants from outside Barcelona, who often came fleeing hunger in the countryside to work in the ever more active industries in the city. Despite the natural darkness of El Raval, where it seems the sun finds it hard to shine in the middle of the humid narrow streets, Antoni Gaudí also left a colourful impression in the shape of <strong>Palau Güell</strong>, the family home of the businessman Eusebi Güell and the first great work of the Modernista architect, on Carrer Nou de la Rambla.</p>
<h3>Transformation of the neighbourhood</h3>
<p>At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, due to its proximity to the port, this became Barcelona&#8217;s <em>barri xinès</em>, or Chinatown. The centre of working-class riots, it was hit hard by the wars, which did not help El Raval lose the air of a marginal outskirt that hung over it for years. But the good times finally did come to the &#8220;<em>xinès</em>&#8220;: The opening up of the <strong>Rambla del Raval</strong> in the late 20th century, the renovation of many of the houses and iconic buildings, the positioning of more modern museums, like the <strong>Museu d’Art Contemporani</strong> (MACBA) and the <strong>Centre de Cultura Contemporània</strong> (CCCB), the opening of the <strong>Filmoteca de Catalunya</strong> building and, more than anything else, the &#8220;reconquest&#8221; of the streets and squares by the people has transformed El Raval into a neighbourhood that offers a richer and more varied culture, that every day attracts more artists and artisans and where new ideas are always emerging. The streets are the same, but today they seem wider, more full of light and life. The mixed backgrounds of the people and the great cultural life here makes this neighbourhood one of the liveliest in the city, and <em>ravalejant</em> lets you discover the many worlds in one which is El Raval.</p>

<p>Barceloneta, Ciutat Vella&#8217;s <strong>marine neighbourhood</strong>, has always been linked to the sea. Its history goes back to the 18th century, when it was established as a new, planned neighbourhood, with a <strong>Baroque grid layout</strong> that has been preserved almost intact. At that time it was a sandy area on the outskirts of the old walled city, which was reached through the <strong>Portal del Mar</strong>, the gate located approximately where the Museu d’Història de Catalunya is today, in the <strong>Palau del Mar</strong>.</p>
<p>Notable features from its early days are the long streets and terraced houses open to the sea, as well as the <strong>Baroque Sant Miquel church</strong>, which presides over the square of the same name, in the centre of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Barceloneta&#8217;s houses were occupied by sailors, fishermen, tradespeople linked to the sea and others from all over that came looking for cheap rents. Citizens all, who gave a unique character to this neighbourhood designed around the sea.</p>
<p>In the mid-19th century, fishermen gave way to workers from the metallurgical trades. The <strong>Catalana de Gas tower</strong>, an impressive pre-Modernista structure, still remains from this era, as well as <strong>Barceloneta market</strong>, which has been remodelled by the team of the late architect Enric Miralles, renovating the wrought iron structure and combining it with modern features. A place that is destined to become a reference in the neighbourhood and the city.</p>
<h3>Next to the beach</h3>
<p>The beginning of the 20th century saw Barcelona opening up to the beaches. The bathing areas, which began appearing all along the coast, were particularly important to the Barceloneta neighbourhood, as they meant the start of a new and thriving trade: food and drink. <strong>Bars, inns and restaurants</strong> provided food for the thousands of bathers who came here in search of the sea.</p>
<p>The Barcelona Olympics in 1992 meant another revolution for Barceloneta. The construction of the Olympic Village surrounded the traditional fishermen&#8217;s quarter with sculptures and modern buildings. Today, flanking the neighbourhood&#8217;s coastline is the <strong><em>El Peix</em> sculpture by Frank Gehry</strong>, an enormous golden fish that seems to float above the sea, while on the other side there is the huge sail-like silhouette of <strong>Hotel W</strong>. Two features that frame tradition with their modernity.</p>
<p>Barceloneta, in the middle, with chairs positioned outside doorways, washing hung out on balconies and the typical smell of fish in the air, is one of the most fascinating places where you will find authentic seaside life in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Passeig de Gràcia, which links the old town with Avda Diagonal, is so named because in times gone by it was the road linking old, walled Barcelona with the then town of Gràcia, today another city neighbourhood. At the end of the 19th century, when <strong>Ildefons Cerdà</strong> planned the city&#8217;s <strong>expansion</strong>, he turned this road into one of the main arteries of his project, making it very wide and prominent.</p>
<p>Its commercial importance attracted the <strong>wealthiest businessmen</strong>, who began to build their own buildings on the avenue and compete to see who had the most luxurious and extravagant house. This meant that the <strong>Modernista architects</strong> of the period were allowed to give free reign to their imaginations and design the magnificent buildings which give it its unique value today. <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, the most unique of all, designed Casa Milà, better known as <strong>La Pedrera </strong>(the quarry), with its surprising undulating facade, and <strong>Casa Batlló</strong>, with its dragon-shaped roof. Just next to it, <strong>Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong> built <strong>Casa Amatller</strong>, a house with a triangular facade in a colourful Modernista style reminiscent of Catalan Gothic, while further down, close to Plaça de Catalunya, <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong> constructed <strong>Casa Lleó Morera</strong>.</p>

<p>A broad avenue over one and a half kilometres long, with <strong>mansions</strong> and <strong>gardens</strong> on either side where the city&#8217;s most well-off families could settle, away from the Eixample grid, the blocks of flats and the factories. An avenue where it would be possible to breathe the <strong>fresh mountain air</strong> and that, in part, imitated the big Parisian boulevards. This was the dream that Dr Andreu, a Barcelona doctor who had made a fortune from his famous cough sweets, realised in 1897.</p>
<p>Avinguda del Tibidabo has not changed its appearance in over a hundred years. It still maintains the <strong>garden-city</strong> design conceived by Dr Andreu, with its <strong>private mansions</strong> on both sides, for the most powerful families. This elegant avenue ends in <strong>Plaça del Doctor Andreu</strong> and is connected from the bottom to the top, by a tram: the <strong>Tramvia Blau del Tibidabo</strong>. Climbing on board is like entering a page of Barcelona&#8217;s history, the chapter in which the best architects of the <strong>Modernista era</strong>, such as Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Joan Rubió i Bellvé, Enric Sagnier and Adolf Ruiz Casamitjana built residences and mansions, each more spectacular than the last, competing in their style and how striking they were: Mediaevalist, Neo-Gothic, Modernista, Noucentista, with limitless possibilities. A funicular runs from Plaça del Dorctor Andreu to the top of Tibidabo, where there is a big amusement park and a church, the <strong>Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor.</strong></p>
<h3>Fairy-tale mansions and gardens</h3>
<p>From the <strong>Rotonda</strong>, an old Modernista-style hotel where the Tramvia Blau sets off from, the avenue opens in front of you. You can walk up, beginning with the <strong>Tamarita Gardens</strong>, a romantic oasis of plant life open to the public. As the avenue continues to climb you will see <strong>Casa Coll</strong>, Xalet Ignacio Portabella, <strong>the Roviralta</strong>, <strong>Casa Fornells</strong>, <strong>Casa Muley Afid </strong>– a mansion built by an uprooted sultan who ended up in Catalonia <strong>Casa Muntades</strong>, and so on till you reach Casa Evarist Arnús, <strong>the Pinar</strong> or pine forest, a Neo-Gothic mansion resembling a fairytale castle that is illuminated at night and forms part of the Tibidabo landscape.</p>
<p>There were no limits on this avenue, which housed the most important families in Barcelona. The zeal for demolition of the 1970s and 80s did not touch the avenue, where the houses have now become universities, colleges, consulates, advertising agencies and the occasional restaurant. All of them have preserved the splendour of Dr Andreu&#8217;s dream.</p>

<p>Walking aimlessly through the streets and squares of El Born and La Ribera transports you back to the Middle Ages, when this area was one of the city&#8217;s main districts, full of palaces and mansions built by the wealthy merchants. With imposing Gothic precincts like <strong>La Llotja</strong>, the exchange where they conducted the business that kept them going, but also numerous humble artisans, guilds and sailors who, in only 55 years, and without the help of the powerful classes, were able to build the <strong>Santa Maria del Mar church</strong>, the best example of Catalan Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>In 1714, the medieval district suffered the defeat in the War of Succession, and was severely damaged. In remembrance of those who fell in this war, a flame is kept burning in <strong>Fossar de les Moreres</strong>, next to Santa Maria del Mar. If you want to learn about the history of that time you should go to the <strong>Born Cultural Centre</strong>, a Modernista market converted into a museum which houses the remains of the city that disappeared under the bombs.</p>
<h3>A neighbourhood of artists, past and present</h3>
<p>La Ribera was, and still is, a neighbourhood of contrasts. Today, the palaces in <strong>Carrer Montcada</strong>, old mansions, are occupied by museums and art galleries, the most notable being the <strong>Museu Picasso</strong>, which holds the early work of this painting genius. Picasso had his workshop in the neighbourhood, as did the painters Rusiñol and Casas. In fact, there were so many artists who set up in La Ribera and El Born that these neighbourhoods were considered to be <strong>Barcelona&#8217;s Montmartre</strong>. The legacy of this can still be seen today, as many new creators have moved into iconic spaces, where new trends are found side-by-side with medieval remains and the memory of traders and merchants. It has become one of the most modern and cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in Barcelona, with the hippest fashion showrooms found alongside gourmet shops and the latest trends in restaurant culture.</p>

<p>Open from Sants to the sea, El Paral·lel crosses three of the city&#8217;s districts (Sants-Montjuïc, Eixample and Ciutat Vella) with its own identity linked to its origins. The avenue was designed by architect and urban planner <strong>Ildefons Cerdà</strong>, who also created  the famous Eixample layout, and opened in 1894 in an area of vegetable plots and factories that seemed a no man&#8217;s land. There are various theories on why it is called Paral·lel, but the most surprising suggests that it is due to the fact that it coincides exactly with the <strong>41st parallel</strong>.</p>
<h3>Avenue of lights</h3>
<p>This so-called no man&#8217;s land very soon forgot its factory beginnings and today only the <strong>three chimneys</strong> of the old La Canadiense electric plant remain. Immediately it opened up to the world as one of Europe&#8217;s most important roads in terms of leisure activities, parties and scoundrels. El Paral·lel filled with cafes, theatres, music halls, circuses and cabarets, and vaudeville and cuplé held their own against the performances at the Liceu. There was fun to be had for all the working classes, who flocked here from the crowded neighbourhoods of Ciutat Vella. But El Paral·lel also attracted the rich and upper classes from the higher areas of the city, looking for an environment far from their stiff morals, as well as political radicals and anarchists, like Lerroux and El Noi del Sucre (the Sugar Boy), who wanted anonymity for their meetings among the masses who invaded this wide avenue. El Paral·lel had everything for everyone, and there were revues like those of the famous Bella Dorita, and works of playwrights such as Santiago Rusiñol, author of the famous play <em>L&#8217;auca del senyor Esteve </em>(Mr. Stephen&#8217;s Storybook).</p>
<p><strong>El Molino</strong>, one of the best-known burlesque cafes in Europe and a tribute to the Moulin Rouge in Paris, has been preserved from that time. But other playhouses, like the <strong>Apolo</strong>, <strong>Teatre Victòria</strong>, <strong>Condal</strong> and <strong>BARTS</strong> mean that the curtain is always about to go up.</p>

<p>The two main buildings in Plaça de Sant Jaume are where many of the decisions are taken that affect the lives of the citizens Barcelona and Catalonia. On one side is the <strong>Palau de la Generalitat</strong>, with the statue of St George on the balcony, built in the 15th century. On the other is the Clock Building, <strong>City Hall</strong>, with its Neoclassical facade and statues of James l and the councillor, Joan Fiveller, flanking the entrance.</p>
<p>The Palau de la Generalitat is an<strong> eminently Gothic </strong>building that for the most part maintains its original appearance. The two side facades are Gothic but not the main one, which came later and is in the <strong>Renaissance style</strong> of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. The Golden Chamber and the Orange-Tree Courtyard are also Renaissance, while the four columns at the entrance date from the 2nd century and come from a Roman temple in Tarragona. The Staircase of Honour and the statue of <strong>Sant Jordi</strong> (St George) on the facade were added in the 19th century.</p>
<p>As for City Hall, the <strong>Casa Gran</strong>, this dates back to 1369, when a start was made on the <strong>Saló de Cent</strong>, the Hall of One Hundred, to provide the councillors with a public building. The <strong>Gothic facade</strong> on Carrer de la Ciutat is still there, while the main, Neoclassical facade was built in 1847.</p>
<h3>The core of the city</h3>
<p>Plaça de Sant Jaume beats in time with the city. As well as having the two institutional buildings, it is an important public <strong>meeting point</strong>, where human-tower (<em>castell</em>) displays and concerts are held during the annual Mercè and Santa Eulàlia festivals, a Nativity scene (<em>pessebre</em>) is set up at Christmas and many demonstrations and rallies take place. It is also common to see newlyweds coming out of City Hall when they have just got married.</p>
<p>Leaving the square, a very short distance away are the Cathedral, the Rambla, the Boqueria and the Born, to mention just four iconic spots.</p>

<p>On <strong>11 September 1714</strong>, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Barcelona surrendered to the Bourbon troops after 13 months of resistance and Philip V triumphantly entered the city. A harsh repression of both the populace and the Catalan institutions followed. Over time, 11 September became the <strong>National Day of Catalonia</strong>, the <strong><em>Diada</em></strong>, and the Fossar de les Moreres cemetery became the setting for annual political, social and cultural events.</p>
<h3>Defenders of the homeland</h3>
<p>At the side separating the square from the street, Carrer de Santa Maria, you can read an <strong>inscription</strong> taken from the famous poem by Frederic Soler <em>Pitarra</em>, paying tribute to those who fell during the siege:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Al fossar de les moreres / no s’hi enterra cap traïdor</em>; <em>/ fins perdent nostres banderes / serà l’urna de l’honor” (</em>In the graveyard of the mulberry trees / no traitor is buried / Even if we lose our flags / it will be our urn of honour)</p>
<p>These lines, which also appear on a commemorative plaque at the back of the square in the shade of the mulberry trees, refer to an <strong>episode during the</strong> <strong>siege</strong>, when apparently the gravedigger and his grandson refused to bury the corpse of an enemy soldier, despite the fact that he belonged to the same family (he was the son of the gravedigger and father of the grandson).</p>
<p>From a more universal perspective, the Fossar de les Moreres could be interpreted as a reminder of all anonymous combatants, a kind of <strong>tomb of the unknown soldier</strong> similar to those in other European cities.</p>
<p>The cemetery is right in the middle of the <strong>Ribera</strong> neighbourhood, surrounded by historical buildings and places of great heritage interest, such as the Church of Santa Maria del Mar itself, Carrer de Montcada and <strong>Passeig del Born</strong>, where centennial shops stand next to fashion boutiques.</p>

The apse and nave of the original church were built in the 9th century, and other elements were subsequently added and modified. The church was burned down in 1936 at the outbreak of the Civil War and it was later restored by the hiking group, Els Blaus de Sarrià.</p>
<p>For a short period there was a <strong>castle</strong> beside the church, but it is no longer there. It was built during the 14th century and belonged to King Peter of Aragon, who sold it. Unfortunately, documents from 1430 already mention it as a rundown, half-abandoned building. Other sites of interest in this area include the <strong>Torre del Bisbe</strong> (Bishop&#8217;s Tower) and the <strong>Font de Santa Margarita </strong>(Saint Margaret&#8217;s Fountain).</p>

<p>Plaça de Catalunya was built in 1889, following Barcelona&#8217;s Universal Exhibition. Its purpose then, as it is today, was to link the new Eixample district with the old centre. From the beginning it has always been one of Barcelona&#8217;s breathing spaces, packed with cafés and restaurants that have seen literary and political debates, and which are still some of the main meeting points, even today. The square, which covers <strong>48,500 square metres</strong>, became a city icon and holds public events, concerts and various civic gatherings. These days it is a major hub and is, in fact, regarded as Barcelona&#8217;s nerve centre.</p>
<h3>A square with art</h3>
<p>It is surrounded by imposing buildings, and <strong>two big fountains</strong> add a touch of beauty to the upper side of this huge square, which is enriched with lots of urban art, <strong>sculptures</strong> such as <em>The Goddess</em>, by Josep Clarà; the Francesc Macià Monument by Josep Maria Subirachs; <em>The Shepherds</em>, by Pau Gargallo; and works by other artists, such as Josep Llimona and Enric Casanova.</p>
<p>Below ground lies <strong>Avinguda de la Llum</strong>, a large underground avenue that was one of the city&#8217;s first shopping centres and sparked the busy commercial activity in the square where, today, there are some big malls like El Triangle.</p>
<p>The extent of the city&#8217;s diversity is revealed in Plaça de Catalunya, a place where tourists, travellers, city dwellers and vendors, shops, and benches all meld together.

<p>On La Rambla you can <strong><em>ramblejar</em></strong>, in other words, you can wander up and down time and again on Barcelona&#8217;s great boulevard, for nothing more than the pleasure it gives you, because it makes you feel at home. Because La Rambla is <strong>welcoming and inclusive</strong>. Here walk humble workers and the rich and powerful on their way to the Liceu, the shopkeepers from Ciutat Vella and the sailors who arrive in the port. Those who have lived here for years and those that are visiting for the first time. Everyone rambles on La Rambla. And this is the <strong>essence of Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<h3>La Rambla’s five <em>ramblas</em></h3>
<p>When, in the 19th century, Barcelona broke free of its suffocating walls, it built a great promenade to join the upper part of the city, the mountain side, with Ciutat Vella, the sea side. La Rambla consists of <strong>five stretches</strong> with different names. Beginning in Plaça de Catalunya and heading down La Rambla, towards the port, is La <strong>Rambla de Canaletes</strong>, where you find the Font de Canaletes, a 19th century fountain. If you drink from it, they say you are sure to return to Barcelona. A little further down is La <strong>Rambla dels Estudis</strong>, so called because one of the city&#8217;s first universities was located here. It closed in the 18th century when Philip V abolished the Catalan universities. In this area you can also find <strong>Palau de la Virreina</strong>, a fine example of civil architecture and a great gift of love from the Viceroy of Peru to his second wife. Continuing towards the sea, you come to La <strong>Rambla de les Flors</strong>, the only place in 19th century Barcelona you could buy flowers, and which keeps the trade alive today. <strong>La Boqueria</strong> and the <strong>Liceu</strong>, one a temple to food and the other to music, begin the fourth Rambla, La <strong>Rambla dels Caputxins</strong>, so called because of the Capuchin monastery that used to be there.

<p>Built in the 19th century as a <strong>textile mill</strong>, Can Batlló, with a surface area comparable to that of the Camp Nou football stadium, originally stood next to El Vapor Vell i l’Espanya Industrial, one of the most important <strong>factory complexes </strong>of the time. Today, after more than 30 years in disuse, it is a space that is once again bustling with activity and initiative, which has been handed over to the public and is managed by the people of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In 2009, the local residents set up the platform <strong>&#8220;Can Batlló és pel barri&#8221;</strong> (Can Batlló belongs to the neighbourhood) and, thanks to this social movement, in 2011 the people were given permanent rights to use one of the buildings, known as <strong>Bloc Onze</strong>. Workshops on infrastructure, carpentry, circus skills, and musical creation are just some of the activities on the long list that have, little by little, filled the space and created a <strong>mini-universe </strong>that attracts everyone to it, crossing the borders of the La Bordeta neighbourhood and extending as far as the people of Sants, Badal, and even further afield.</p>
<h3>A neighbourhood&#8217;s heart</h3>
<p>At the same time the number of initiatives has also increased, amongst which is the work of the <strong>Arquitectes de la Col</strong>, a group of young architecture professionals who joined the local residents in their fight and who took on the responsibility for breathing new life into the abandoned industrial units.</p>
<p>As well as being a multifunctional place for expression and creativity, open to everyone, Can Batlló has become a <strong>symbol of culture </strong>and <strong>horizontal organisation</strong>, an integral part of the La Bordeta neighbourhood and the Sants-Montjuïc district.</p>

It has undergone many renovations over its history. Its current appearance comes from its reconstruction after the War of the Spanish Succession and the defeat of Barcelona on 11 September 1714, when the house was burnt down.  Even so, an inscription on the entrance gate pre-dating all that, from 1610, bears the name of the then owner (Benet Vinyals de la Torre) and his family’s coat of arms.

The Fab Ateneu Les Corts, a large creative laboratory that shares its location with the new Montserrat Abelló Library. The library and the Fab Lab therefore create synergies, as they share resources, mutually strengthen their dynamics and provide improved access to information and knowledge. The aim is to make the tools and machinery needed for creating prototypes and developing projects available to everyone. The two facilities are located in the former Benet Campabadal factory, built in 1924 and a pioneer in silk ribbon manufacturing. The factory was operational for many years, but the constant rise in land prices led to its closure in 1984. In 1990, it became the venue for the Glass Centre Foundation, a meeting point for glass trades, industry and art.</p>
<p>In 2013, on the initiative of Barcelona City Council, it was decided to create the Les Corts Ateneu de Fabricació Digital, with the aim of creating a <strong>space for debate and technological creation</strong> that was within everyone&#8217;s reach and today it serves as a place where all those who wish to do so can express their <strong>talent and creativity</strong>, as it is the first public Fab Lab in the world.</p>
<h3>Technology within everyone&#8217;s reach</h3>
<p>The centre, close to Plaça del Centre, is housed in the <strong>old Benet Campabadal factory</strong>, measuring more than 1,000 square metres, and it provides members of the public with access to 3D printers, mechanisation centres, 3D scanners and a laser cutter, among many other pieces of equipment, enabling them to turn their ideas into physical products which are useful to society.

<p>During the Second Spanish Republic, architects from the Group of Cat­alan Architects and Technicians for the Development of Contemporary Architecture (GATCPAC) designed the Casa Bloc, a very innovative social project that was embodied in five interlinked blocks in an S shape with 207 dwellings. This pioneering building stands as one of the most rep­resentative icons of rationalist architecture in Catalonia. It was a very innovative social project for its time as it meant integrating functional housing into the urban environment designed as minimum standard dwellings for workers, who until then had lived in the slums in the outskirts of the city. Its construction was promoted by the Generalitat of Catalonia, which commissioned the Group of Catalan Archi­tects and Technicians for the Development of Contemporary Architecture (GATCPAC) to build it. The purpose of the building was to provide decent housing for the working population. The great wave of immigrants coming to the city in search of work had highlighted the serious shortage of housing for workers. The pres­ident Francesc Macià was responsible for placing the first stone of the Casa Bloc on 13 March 1933. The result was a set of five blocks in an S shape containing 207 flats between 55 and 77 m². The project incorporated optimum ventilation and lighting for all homes. The interior spaces were allocated to public services such as children’s play areas, gardens, nurseries, libraries, consumer cooperatives and workers’ clubs. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the establishment of the Franco regime prevented the Republican project from being implemented, which would have contributed to improving the living conditions of the working class. During the Spanish Civil War, frequent bombings in the Sant Andreu area led to the installation of an anti-aircraft machine gun on the roof of Casa Bloc. Forces of the Army Corps of Navarra stayed in the barracks in Sant Andreu and the Casa Bloc, which had been left unfinished when the war broke out.</p>
<h3>A 1930s flat</h3>
<p>The Disseny Hub de Barcelona has renovated one of the flats as a <strong>flat-museum</strong>, restoring the original hydraulic paving, the foldable doors (taken from other flats in disuse), the economical kitchens, the laundry with shower, separate toilet, and even original 1930s furniture. A flat-museum you can visit to see how <strong>rationalist</strong> <strong>architecture</strong> thought about functional houses that would bring dignity to the harsh living conditions of workers in Sant Andreu.</p>

<p>In 1891 the city council planned to build a pumping station in Trinitat to raise and channel water from the Montcada mine. The project was designed by the architect Pere Falqués i Urpí. The result was a set of modernist buildings (1915 &#8211; 1917), some with one storey and others with a basement. When Avinguda Merid-iana was created, the water treatment centre and the attached house stayed in Trinitat Nova, while the pumping centre and the Casa del Guarda were in Trinidad Vella. The Casa de l’Aigua is one of the heritage sites of the Barcelona City History Museum. When bombing first took place in Trinitat Vella, residents used the underground facilities of the Casa de l’Aigua, a pumping station that raised and channelled water from the Montcada mine, to pro¬tect themselves from air attacks. The neighbourhood was located between several military targets: the artillery barracks of Sant Andreu, the Casa de l’Aigua and the Puigcerdà rail line. One of the first bombings in the neighbourhood was carried out on 25 July 1937 by six or seven aircraft from a base in Mallorca. The Pont dels Tres Ulls (a bridge), today buried underground, was also used as a shelter during the first air raids, which was an access point to the underground gallery connecting the Casa de l’Aigua in Trinitat Vella to the water treatment centre in Trinitat Nova. Later, residents were mobilised to build shelters closer to their homes as the Casa de l’Aigua was quite secluded. Seventeen shelters were built in Trinitat Vella during the war.</p>
<h3>A building at the neighbourhood’s service</h3>
<p>The Museum of History of Barcelona, together with different institutions in the Sant Andreu and Nou Barris districts, is working on a process to adapt all the facilities and open them to the public. The goal is to make it possible for <strong>visitors to view the main facilities</strong>, such as the Trinitat Vella pumping station and water tank and the pipes that connect them and the rest of the city, in order to show how the supply of drinking water to large cities worked. Casa de l’Aigua has housed a vocational training centre since the early twenty-first century and also gave its name to a new underground station when the Metro reached the neighbourhood in 2003.</p>

Flora constructs her pieces with the wisdom she acquired from botany: each species, colour or aroma needs to be considered for meeting any request; branches, leaves and countless other materials combine to make up the final project. Even her workshop conveys the idea that no detail is there for its own sake: everything is part of a whole. While she works, her library beckons you to sit down, enjoy a cup of something relaxing and delve into floral culture. The garden is a space for discovery, an oasis where you can grab a chair and combine the pleasure of reading with the aroma in the air, the sound of flowing water and the explosion of colour in Flora&#8217;s garden.</p>

It is a small, sheltered area, an ideal place for <strong>enjoying nature </strong>while relaxing or reading. The renovation work conserved the original design&#8217;s mosaics, paths and steps. Local residents campaigned to make the gardens a city facility, and prevented flats being built on the site.</p>
<h3>From a modernista house to college</h3>
<p>The house that crowns the gardens is a wonderful example of the most austere Modernisme, with <strong>facing-brick trimmings </strong>on the facade and under the windows. The roof, which is split into two sections by a <strong>terrace with wooden balustrades</strong>, is one of the most spectacular parts of the building. It is listed as a Cultural Asset of Local Interest (BCIL).</p>

<p>From a textile mill to a museum of contemporary painting. Can Framis, an old <strong>textile factory</strong> dating back to the 18th century and now a museum, is a place for <strong>contemplating art</strong>, an area where innovation and new production methods are leaving their mark. The idea was not to leave this past behind, so in reclaiming this old wool mill, at first glance a building with hardly any architectural interest, it was decided to use materials that would form a <strong>collage of textures</strong>. The museum, with its rough concrete, bare brick walls and boarded up windows, all covered with a sheen of grey paint, seeks to represent the <strong>passing of time</strong> and show how the different interventions have turned the Can Framis wool mill into one of the city&#8217;s most interesting pictorial museums. The <strong>quiet Miquel Martí i Pol Gardens</strong>, with their neutral colours and whites, poplar trees silently caressing the benches and the ivy that covers the avenue, are a respite from the hyperactive 22@ neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>An oasis of art</h3>
<p>The Can Framis collection is a Vila Casas Foundation project with some 600 paintings and <strong>contemporary artworks</strong> from the 1960s to the present day. The whole complex, comprising the museum, factory buildings and gardens, contrasts with the technology that surrounds it, a half-hidden <strong>oasis of peace</strong> well worth a visit.</p>

<p>Designed by the French architect <strong>Jean Nouvel</strong>, Poblenou&#8217;s innovative Parc del Centre opened in the spring of 2008. Covering <strong>5.5 hectares </strong>, this huge green lung lies between Carrer de Bilbao, Carrer de Marroc, Bac de Roda and Avinguda Diagonal, which define the <strong>inclusive, social spirit</strong> of the new Poblenou neighbourhood.</p>
<p><strong>Curious shapes and abundant vegetation</strong> welcome and accompany visitors from the entrance, where a large perimeter wall covered with Mediterranean plants allows access to the park interior through a Gaudï-style gate.</p>
<p>The park, designed to facilitate <strong>nature breaks</strong> and conceived with everyone in mind, has areas for walking, courts for various games and charming spots to enjoy a spot of reading. Right in the middle there is <strong>Plaça de la Sardana</strong>, a meeting point surrounded by huts where kids can play.</p>
<h3>Design and sustainability</h3>
<p>The concern with <strong>preserving the environment</strong> is reflected in some features of the park, for example, a pneumatic refuse-collection plant hidden in an area resembling a <strong>lunar landscape</strong>, or the irrigation system that uses groundwater.</p>
<p>Nouvel wanted this <strong>signature park</strong> to be a place that combined different habitats, so he created three clearly differentiated areas. The <em>Cràter-pou del Món</em>, probably the most surprising, is a spiral path surrounded by bougainvillaea that looks like a volcanic crater. <em>Nius i Pous del Cel</em> (nests and cells) is a space with large metal structures covered in climbing plants and flowers. And the <em>Voltes i Falgueres Gegants</em> lead to the lunar landscape under four fern-covered arches. It is worth sitting and resting on one of the metal chairs designed by the architect that are submerged in the shade of the park&#8217;s lush, colourful, plants and trees.</p>

The type of construction used, built on various floors, which extended through­out Barcelona in the mid-19th century, resulted in the transformation of industrial areas into large warehouses with rows of iron columns, creating open, flexible spaces. This former spinning mill with solid brick walls, large windows and doorways with semi-circular arches was one of the most important in the area of Barcelona. Although it began operating in the late 19th century, it took its definitive name in 1903 when the Catalan Camil Fabra merged its industrial heritage with the Scottish company Coats. What was one of the most important textile factories in Barcelona has now been converted into a space for creativity, culture, history and education. The grounds of Fabra i Coats also house the Tres Tombs Inter­pretation Centre of Sant Andreu, the Casal de Barri of Sant Andreu (a civic centre), the La Filadora Municipal Bressol School, the Can Fabra School and many other organisations</p>
<h3>Threading the past</h3>
<p>The sirens that signalled the times when workers entered and left Fabra i Coats were also those that regulated life in the old town of Sant Andreu. The <strong>Hilaturas de Fabra i Coats</strong> company became the main production centre for Sant Andreu&#8217;s local residents, along with Ca l’Alzina, also known as Can Mamella, which provided work for over 1,500 people at the beginning of the 20th century, giving jobs to many women and providing subsistence to many families. Fabra i Coats stood on an <strong>industrial site</strong> occupying two whole blocks that today, thanks to the efforts of local people, have been turned into a <strong>space reclaimed </strong>for public use: 30,000 square metres housing a large cultural and social centre.</p>
<p>The cotton spinning company was set up in 1839 but it was not until 1903, when it merged with the Scottish company J&amp;P Coats, that it acquired the name it became known by everywhere, Fabra i Coats. And it adopted a <strong>surprising business model</strong> for the time, introducing improvements for the workers such as paid holidays, onsite nursery schools and healthcare.</p>
<h3>The factory in the 21st century</h3>
<p>Fabra i Coats gave <strong>Sant Andreu</strong> an industrial colony that remains to this day. Industrial reconversion led to the factory&#8217;s closure but the City Council bought the land and factory premises for cultural use.  Fabra i Coats, having sustained generations and generations of Sant Andreu&#8217;s local residents, reinvented itself to become a first-class <strong>cultural centre</strong>: the Can Fabra Centre.</p>
<p>The Fabra i Coats industrial grounds currently holds an artistic-creation laboratory, the Fabra i Coats &#8211; Creation Factory, the Contemporary Art Centre, the Can Fontanet &#8211; Els Tres Tombs Information Centre, the Sant Andreu neighbourhood centre and the Josep Bota social and cultural space, among other benchmark places. It also includes Can Fabra, the old Rec Factory building built around 1880, which became a cultural centre containing the Ignasi Iglésias Library and Musicians’ Workshop. Where before workers spun cotton thread, today their grandchildren and great grandchildren enjoy themselves, grow up and create art.</p>

<p>Among the strange and curious spots found in Barcelona, the Costa i Llobera Gardens, situated at the foot of <strong>Montjuïc</strong> facing the sea, are one of the most special. The gardens stretch over six hectares and offer a <strong>journey to faraway lands </strong>through some of the most exotic cactus species on the planet. Semi-desert, tropical and desert species, and others from high mountain regions. The area where the park is located has its own <strong>microclimate </strong>with an average temperature that is two to three degrees warmer than the rest of the city, making it the perfect place for these types of plants.</p>
<h3>One of the best gardens in the world</h3>
<p>The Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens were created in 1970 and are named after the <strong>Mallorcan poet </strong>Miquel Costa i Llobera, author of the poem <em>El Pi de Formentor</em>. It was a joint venture undertaken by the architect Joan Maria Casamor and a teacher from the gardening school who specialises in succulent plants, Joan Pañella. Since their inauguration, the gardens have undergone an extensive <strong>remodelling process</strong>, with the replanting of a large number of plants that fell victim to the icy weather of 1985 and 1987. Despite this, the New York Times published an article declaring them to the be among the best gardens in the world. As well as the 800 species of <strong>cactus and succulent plants</strong>, the gardens offer stunning <strong>panoramic views </strong>over the city&#8217;s coastline and port. They are just ten minutes from the Columbus statue and the Rambla Santa Mònica and, although they have been there a while, they are relatively unknown, even among local residents. A tour of this enormous park is a live, open-air lesson on the most impressive succulent plants, which are very different from the type of vegetation you tend to find in a Mediterranean climate like Barcelona&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Since 1898 this theatre has been a fixture at the end of <strong>Avinguda del Paral·lel</strong>, an area that was previously considered to be the Broadway of Barcelona or the Catalan Montmartre due to the number of <strong>theatres and concert</strong> <strong>cafes </strong>located there.

<p>With a <strong>tradition of breaking</strong> new ground, this theatre has always been appreciated for its ability to escape censure, by creating its <strong>own language</strong> of double entendre that pushes the boundaries of acceptability.</p>
<h3>A name with history</h3>
<p>Originally christened <strong>La Pajarera Catalana </strong>(the Catalan birdcage), it was renamed the <strong>Petit Moulin Rouge</strong> after being renovated in 1910. In 1929 it got a new, specially made facade and the red windmill sails alluding to its name, which it kept until the end of the Spanish Civil War. With the establishment of the dictatorship, the Franco regime forced the name to be changed to Spanish and the word &#8220;rouge&#8221; had to be removed because of the political connotations of the colour red. The new Molino continued its run until 1997, when it closed.</p>
<p>Bought by the Catalan group Ociopuro, who began a complete renovation, but keeping the unique facade from 1929, El Molino once again opened its doors in 2010, proud to be what it is. Each evening, just as it has done throughout its long history, it offers music hall, burlesque shows and flamenco dances, as well as being a restaurant and disco.</p>

<p>Located right at the entrance to Parc de la Creueta del Coll, Finca Sansalvador was built by the architect <strong>Josep Maria Jujol</strong>, a disciple of Gaudí, at the request of <strong>Dr Sansalvador</strong> and it became known as a curious site in the <strong>Gràcia neighbourhood</strong>. At first, the owner intended to build a <strong>summer residence</strong> facing Passeig de la Mare de Déu del Coll and build another house to be rented out at the top part. The curious thing is that, during the execution work, a <strong>water mine</strong> with alleged radiological and medicinal properties was discovered which the doctor decided to market under the <strong>Agua Radial </strong>brand. For this reason, Sansalvador changed his original plan and built a series of <strong>grottos to access </strong>the spring, to take the water to the bottling plant, and a romantic garden to incorporate them into a natural landscape, even though the water did not turn out to be as miraculous as he thought.</p>
<h3>Jujol</h3>
<p>Today, all that remains of the interrupted project is the <strong>porter&#8217;s lodge</strong>, a small house with a small balcony decorated with coloured ceramic tiles that was recently renovated, in keeping with the original design, especially the garden, with a series of <strong>underground tunnels</strong> which can be accessed through some magnificent parabolic arches that lead to the water spring<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Moll de la Fusta was officially called Bosch i Alsina in honour of the Catalan politician and entrepreneur of that name who had made his fortune in Cuba. Even so, and as often happens with emblematic spaces, its correct name is hardly ever used by anybody.</p>
<p>This <strong>coastal walkway </strong>brings you to the Palau de Mar, the Maremágnum shopping centre and the Columbus viewing point, as well as a number of other emblematic spots. At night, the docks are a lively place through which people pass on their way to the nearby <strong>entertainment areas </strong>of the Maremágnum centre, El Born and La Rambla. However, it has not always been like this: the poet <strong>Joan Salvat-Papasseit</strong>:</p>
<p>described how tough life was at the docks nearly a century ago:<br />“<em>Heus aquí: jo he guardat fusta al moll.</em><br /><em>Vosaltres no sabeu</em><br /><em>què és</em><br /><em>guardar fusta al moll:</em><br /><em>però jo he vist la pluja</em><br /><em>a barrals</em><br /><em>sobre els bots,</em><br /><em>i dessota els taulons arraulir-se el preu fet de l’angoixa;</em><br /><em>sota els flandes</em><br /><em>i els melis,</em><br /><em>sota els cedres sagrats</em>.”<br /><em>Nocturn per a acordió</em> (1925)<br />(&#8220;Behold: I&#8217;ve stored wood on the docks.<br />You don&#8217;t know<br />what it is<br />to store wood on the docks:<br />besides I&#8217;ve seen it bucket<br />down<br />on the boats,<br />and under planks at a fixed price<br />for my troubles;<br />under pines from Flanders<br />and melis,<br />under sacred cedars.”<br /><em>Nocturne for accordion</em> (1925)</p>
<h3>The prawn of Barcelona</h3>
<p>On the upper level of the former docks, there used to be several restaurants but these have since disappeared. One of these was the Gambrinus Restaurant and its roof was capped with a <strong>gigantic 15-metre long prawn</strong>. This prawn was the work of the designer <strong>Mariscal</strong> and it is currently owned by Barcelona City Council, which decided to keep it at the original location even though the restaurant is no longer there. Today, it is one of the city&#8217;s most curious icons. A little further on, and dominating the viewing point of Port Vell, pop artist Roy Lichtenstein’s Barcelona Face sculpture fills the surrounding area with colour.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the relatively modest success of its beginnings, the Castle of the Three Dragons, which took its name from a play by Serafí Pitarra, soon became a symbol of Modernista Barcelona.</p>

<p>The Castle of the Three Dragons brings together some of the most characteristic features of <strong>Catalan Modernisme</strong>: brick construction employing majestic and fanciful shapes (in this case, a castle with a square floor plan and four towers), the use of wrought iron and ceramics for the decor, etc.</p>
<p>The building has had many uses since it was built: a few years after the end of the Universal Exhibition, it reopened as a Museum of History, and in 1920 it was re-furbished to house the Museum of Zoology. It is currently one of the four main centres of the <strong>Museo de Ciencias Naturales</strong> and is dedicated to the research, conservation and dissemination of the museum&#8217;s collections as well as the publication of specialised works.

<p>The Park is made up of <strong>seven institutions</strong>: the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, the Department of Experimental and Health Sciences at Pompeu Fabra University, the Centre for Genomic Regulation, the Barcelona Centre for Regenerative Medicine, the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology, the Pasqual Maragall Foundation and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology. All of these centres are organised according to a <strong>cooperative model</strong> that is also committed to the environment and energy saving.</p>

They consist of an <strong>oval-shaped building</strong> with an open space in the middle, and they cover an area of 55,000m<sup>2</sup> spread out over several levels. The floors are arranged in a horseshoe shape around a central courtyard that has been left empty and this space looks out on the sea. The exterior wood-panelled façade is suspended above the ground and this increases the sense of <strong>lightness</strong>.

<p>After its first <strong>remodelling at the end of the 1950s</strong>, El Trencaones was converted into a wide boulevard.

<p>These days, Passeig de l’Escullera is <strong>five kilometres long </strong>and, after many periods of remodelling, has become <strong>the perfect place for many runners and walkers</strong> as well as a few fishermen.

It is found on a remarkable and inaccessible spot, offering most of the visitors their first sight of the Monastery. In 1945, the Junta Diocesana de Acción Católica commissioned the architects Lluís Bonet and Josep M. Sagnier to build this monumental cross as a means of paying homage to all the crosses that had been pulled down during the Civil War.  There is a second sculptural element, almost hidden from view, situated next to the Monastery wall. It is the memorial put up by Barcelona in 1954 to the Huntingtons, the North American founders of the Hispanic Society of America, with close ties to Catalonia.</p>

<p>Considered to be the pearls of <strong>Montjuïc</strong>, the Laribal gardens extend across a number of different spaces, together creating a unique place of great historical value where it is a real pleasure to take a stroll. The silence of the vegetation and the gentle bubbling sound of the water, the main protagonist, create a <strong>haven of peace</strong>, not far from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p> Associated with the International Exposition of 1929, the Laribal gardens were completed in 1922 and were among the most important installations created for this event. Their designers, Jean-Claude-Nicolas&nbsp;Forestier and Nicolau M. Rubió i Tudurí, wanted to create a new style of Mediterranean landscape, inspired by the ancient Arabian gardens and the <em>&#8216;Cármenes</em>&#8216; of Granada, featuring decorative tiles, ornamental water features and flowering plants in pots on railings.</p>
<h3>Nature and water</h3>
<p>Architecturally, they are comprised of a <strong>series of terraces </strong>joined together by small paths and shortcuts, stairways and enormous pergolas, stones, pillars and fountains offering up jets of cooling water. Sculptures include <em>Estival </em>by Jaume Otero, a female nude in marble, <em>La Noia de la trena</em> by Josep Viladomat, another female nude, this time in bronze, and an enamelled ceramic fountain, the work of ceramicist Llorenç Artigas.</p>
<p> The Generalife stands out for its sheer beauty and historical importance. It connects the Laribal gardens to the Grec Theatre and is inspired by the Generalife gardens of Granada, with water cascading down the handrails, stone ponds and benches for resting on, next to a 19th century building which, in the past, was home to the former owner of the estate, Josep Laribal, and which has now been converted into a restaurant. All together, the Laribal gardens are an exquisite architectural, historical and natural space within Montjuïc park where it is a real pleasure to spend time relaxing and enjoying the tranquility.</p>

<p>Parc de Diagonal Mar, set in the <strong>new Fòrum Barcelona</strong> on a disused factory site, is spread over 14 hectares that branch out in different directions, merging with the city and creating a very open, natural space.</p>
<p>Each part links with the others in a kind of <strong>puzzle</strong> through paths which also branch out and with the help of some very large benches that remind you of the <strong>sea&#8217;s waves</strong>.</p>
<p>The park was the brainchild of the husband-and-wife team of architects Benedetta Tagliabue and Enric Miralles. It opened in 2002 and marked the culmination of their idea of <strong>innovative and sustainable architecture</strong>.</p>
<h3>Contemporary wetlands</h3>
<p>According to people who worked with them, the day they visited the site it had rained and it was covered by pools of water and seagulls. That image immediately gave them the idea of creating a space that would evoke <strong>wetlands</strong>. A place where the green of the grass and plants would mix with the blue of the water in the big lake, the pools and the fountains, producing a <strong>fusion of colours</strong> right across the park.</p>
<p>A raised tubular structure, like a spider&#8217;s web and spreading out in all directions, watches over the park. Here and there this moving line coils round suspended plant plots in a style reminiscent of <strong>Gaudí&#8217;s organic architecture</strong>. This tube contains the water that, apart from irrigating the whole park, unites the different parts: a large kids&#8217; play area, wavy tubular structures, a large central square, etc.</p>
<p>This immense <strong>sunny, open, accessible</strong> space makes Parc de Diagonal Mar the ideal place for walking, doing some sport, playing or even sailing some small model boats.</p>

It was adapted to its new uses under the auspices of the architects Gomà, Ardèvol and Laviá, who preserved Cordech’s original design and aesthetics, a project that earned them the 1981 FAD prize.<br />

<p>El Carmel was a rural area during the early 19th century, with a few scattered farmhouses, notable among which was Can Móra, after which the Muntanya Pelada hill was then known. Its current name derives from the Sanctuary of Nostra Senyora del Carmel, which was built between 1860 and 1864. The little church was built under an initiative from the <strong>hermit Miquel Viladoms</strong>, and years later, it was extended with a new and more contemporary church designed by the architects <strong>Francesc de Paula Daumal </strong>i<strong> Domènech and Miquel Campos Pascual</strong>. The first houses began to be built on the hill in 1875 and these gradually became what is now the El Carmel neighbourhood.</p>

The centre of power of the medieval city, the Palau, built in the 9th century, was the official residence of the Catalan counts from the 8th century to the early 15th century. Even though it contains Visigothic and Roman remains, the style of the building is predominantly Gothic. Its most emblematic room, today a must-visit exhibition room, is the <strong>Saló del</strong><strong> Tinell</strong>, featuring a series of semicircular arches of great architectural value.</p>

<p>On one side of the Palau Reial is the<strong> Torre</strong><strong> Mirador del Rei Martí</strong> (King Martin&#8217;s Watchtower) and on another side, on Barcelona&#8217;s old Roman wall is the royal chapel of <strong>Santa</strong><strong> Àgata</strong>, with ceilings and altarpieces by Jaume Huguet inside. In front is the <strong>Palau</strong><strong> del Lloctinent,</strong> (now the Archive of the Crown of Aragon), which dates back to the 16th century and boasts a valuable Renaissance patio in its interior. </p>
<p> Rounding off this architectural group in the square is the old <strong>Casa</strong><strong> Clariana-Padellàs</strong>, which is currently home to the Museu d&#8217;Història de Barcelona (MUHBA) which, beneath its floors, hides traces of streets, houses and shops from the Roman Barcino.

<p>Also known as the <strong>Pavelló Alemany</strong> (German Pavilion),&nbsp;the Mies van&nbsp;der&nbsp;Rohe Pavilion,hidden away in a corner of Montjuic Park,is a world famous construction and architectural landmark from the early avant-garde period of the 1920s. The architect Mies van der Rohe, who was also director of the Bauhaus, designed this building to represent Germany in the Barcelona International Exposition of 1929. Known as the father of modern architecture, Van der Rohe incorporated in the design of this building the basis of his philosophy: perfect symmetry, translucent spaces, clarity, simplicity and minimalism. This is how he wanted to represent the Germany of the Weimar Republic following the First World War, and this building was intended to be a symbol of all these elements.</p>
<h3>Faithful design</h3>
<p>The pavilion was removed in 1930 and in 1989 it was decided to reconstruct it due to the importance of its design as a piece of <strong>modern architecture</strong>.The four different types of marble originally used, Roman travertine, green marble from the Alps, ancient green marble from Greece and golden onyx from the Atlas Mountains, were also used in the reconstruction, along with the sculpture of George Kolbe strategically located next to the pond, playing with the light and reflections of the water. Currently home to a <strong>Foundation,</strong> the building is open to the public and is mainly dedicated to disseminating the work of the architect and to promoting the debate on architecture and modern and contemporary art.</p>

<p>The Torre de Fang, a medieval tower, was built on the royal road that led from the Portal Nou gate in the walls of Barcelona to the towns of Sant Martí de Provençals and Sant Andreu de Palomar.

<p>The construction of the railway in the mid-19th century forced Torre del Fang to abandon its agricultural past andit soon became a <strong>building materials factory</strong>.

In 1911, Frederick Stark Pearson founded the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Ltd in Toronto, after which it acquired the Compañía Barcelonesa de Electricidad. This is why the factory was known as “La Canadenca” (“the Canadian”). The company was the leading electricity producer in Europe by 1914; and it was hit by a strike a few years later, in 1919, known as the “La Canadenca strike”, which lasted for forty-two days. That strike led to the establishment of an eight-hour work day, as well as other workers&#8217; rights. The Spanish Government approved this measure on 3 April 1919. In 1979 the three chimneys, which would remain in operation until 1989, were listed under Barcelona&#8217;s Catalogue of Historical and Artistic Heritage.</p>

<p>At the top of the <strong>Les Corts</strong> district is the Palau de Pedralbes, a building with medieval origins which was restored in the late 19th century and given to the Spanish royal family by <strong>Count Eusebi Güell</strong> in 1918 to thank them for his noble title, whereupon it was transformed into a <strong>Royal Palace </strong>between 1919 and 1931. Today it is the headquarters of the Secretariat General of the Union for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The building was originally one of the <strong>17th century country houses </strong>built in the area. In 1862 it was purchased, along with a neighbouring country house, by Eusebi Güell, who had alterations carried out on his new estate, known as the <strong>Finca Güell</strong>. The country house was restored by the architect Joan Martorell i Montells, who also built the Caribbean-style palace and Neo-Gothic chapel, which are still there to this day.</p>
<h3>Gardens filled with surprises</h3>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong> was commissioned to build the walls and to design part of the gardens of which the famous <strong>Font d’Hèrcules</strong> fountain survives to this day, featuring a bust of Hercules on a plinth bearing the Catalan coat of arms and a wrought iron dragon that the water flows out of. The fountain, along with the Pavilions of the Finca Güell, forms part of the re-creation of the poem <strong><em>L’Atlàntida</em></strong>, by Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer, that Gaudí so admired. The rest of the garden was designed by Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, who designed the project that can still be seen to this day, with its <strong>decorative geometric layout </strong>featuring large Mediterranean trees, such as palm trees, cypress and pines, a pond and the three famous <strong>luminous fountains </strong>by Carles Buïgas. One outstanding feature is the statue of Queen Isabel II with her son Alfonso XII, the work of Agapit Vallmitjana, and another the pavilion of climbers, one of the <strong>first attempts at the typical Gaudiesque arch</strong>. The famous Palace garden, today populated with numerous <strong>exotic trees </strong>as well as the Mediterranean ones, is continuously visited by tourists and residents wishing to marvel at the <strong>beauty and variety </strong>of the natural space hidden behind its walls.</p>

<p>La Pedrera, or Casa Milà, owes its more popular name, to the controversy it provoked on its completion in <strong>1910</strong>. &#8220;The quarry&#8221; is an insulting name some locals came up with to mock the extravagant and gloomy appearance of its main facade. <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong> was commissioned to do it by the wealthy <strong>Milà family</strong>, who wanted to move to <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong>, like most comfortably-off bourgeois families at the start of the 20th century.</p>
<p>At that time, Gaudí was in his <strong>naturalist phase</strong> and at the height of his creative powers, so the house, inspired by the organic shapes of nature, has an <strong>undulating surface</strong> devoid of any volumetric rigidity. His innovation produced a whole that is a typical Gaudí work, where geometric lines are merely straight lines that form curves. Aside from the impressive <strong>decorated facades</strong>, another outstanding feature of La Pedrera is the roof terrace, with <strong>30 chimneys</strong> representing <strong>petrified warriors</strong> that make an open-air sculpture garden. The powerful religious symbolism Gaudí imbued the building with has also given rise to various interpretations.</p>
<h3>A space to enjoy Gaudí</h3>
<p>La Pedrera is currently owned by the <strong>Fundació Catalunya-La Pedrera</strong>. The foundation keeps <strong>the roof and the attic</strong> open to the public, and there is an <strong>exhibition on Gaudí</strong> and his work.

<p>Plans were first unveiled in 1990 for a centre on a 56,000 square metres<strong> urban site</strong> that occupied an entire block within the neighbourhood of les Corts. The size of the project led it to being called a <em>Supermanzana </em>or Superblock.</p>

<p>L’Illa Diagonal was the city’s first shopping centre to include a wide variety of <strong>shops and restaurants</strong>, as well as an hotel, offices and municipal facilities, and it quickly became a <strong>model of reference</strong> for all the new spaces of this kind that were subsequently inaugurated in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Following the <strong>latest reforms </strong>in 2006, L’Illa Diagonal increased its surface area by a further 4,000 square metres and a number of <strong>new shops</strong> and a large new hotel were opened.</p>

<p>The Palau de Mar started life in 1890 as the General Port Warehouse, for <strong>storing the goods</strong> that arrived in Barcelona by sea. This was renovated and transformed for the 1992 Olympics and today houses the <strong>Museu d’Història de Catalunya</strong>, the Centre of Contemporary History and the Catalan Department of Social Welfare, as well as various offices, restaurants and cafeterias.</p>
<p>Among other things, the 1992 renovation gave the building an upper floor that provided access to the roof terrace, which has become a big hit with locals and tourists alike for the <strong>magnificent vistas</strong> it offers of the port, the sea, Montjuïc and the city in general.</p>
<h3>A stroll through history</h3>
<p>The Museu d’Història de Catalunya, which opened in 1996, preserves and exhibits items that recount the story of life in Catalonia, from the dawn of prehistory to the present day. A visit to the history museum&#8217;s rooms takes you on a real <strong>journey through time</strong> and lets you see all the facets of this many-sided country: from Roman to industrial Catalonia, from the invaded to the invading Catalonia, from a time of great splendour to the painful years following the Civil War, from life in the countryside to life in the cities, and from the past to the present.</p>

As for materials, Gallissà preferred <strong>brick </strong>and <strong>stucco </strong>to the traditional stone, and he combined those with iron, ceramic tiles and glass. The current appearance of the house is very like the original, despite the work carried out to repair the damage caused during the Civil War.</p>

<p>The Pavelló de la República, now a library, is situated at one end of the <strong>La Clota</strong> neighbourhood in the heart of the Horta district. It is a replica, created in 1992, of the Pavilion of the Spanish Republic constructed in Paris to represent Spain at the 1937 Universal Exposition. Those responsible for the original building were the architects <strong>Josep Lluís Sert and Luis Lacasa</strong>, and it was an architectural landmark in its day, due to its <strong>rationalist style</strong>, very much in line with the avant-garde of the era. It was also a <strong>hugely symbolic building</strong>, very much against the Civil War being waged in Spain at that time. In 1992, the architects Espinet i Ubach created an exact replica, using the same precarious materials that were used in the 1930s, to produce a building just like the original: a <strong>large empty container</strong>, almost without walls, through which a route was marked. The compartments close by means of <strong>metal structures</strong>, with glass on the first floor and fibre-cement on the second.</p>
<p><strong>Art and the anti-war movement. </strong>It should be pointed out that, as an anti-war and anti-fascist symbol, the original pavilion displayed some important artworks inside, such as <strong>Pablo Picasso&#8217;s</strong> <em>Guernica</em>, a 1:1 scale replica of which can be found in the current pavilion; <em>The Harvester</em> by <strong>Joan Miró</strong>; and the <em>Font de Mercuri</em> by <strong>Alexander Calder</strong>, which is now on display in the Fundació Joan Miró.</p>

<p>Antoni Gaudí took over the project when the foundations of the building had already been laid. For this reason, he decided to follow the original square-shaped structure, which he built like a castle in reference to one of St. Teresa&#8217;s writings, <em>The Interior Castle</em>. Unlike other commissions, Gaudí had to stick to a relatively low budget, which is why he <strong>used brick</strong> instead of stone, and this also explains the plaster walls of the interior and the restraint shown in the decoration. Although the order&#8217;s vow of poverty prevented the construction of an ostentatious building, the result was a <strong>gigantic building</strong> with more than a few decorative elements, which went quite a bit beyond modesty. Gaudi&#8217;s work was finished in 1889, and the building has been on the <strong>heritage list</strong> since 1969. </p>
<h3>Gaudí&#8217;s personal stamp</h3>
<p>The most prolific architect of Catalan <em>Modernisme</em> is famous for his highly personal architectural solutions as well as the symbolism of the elements he used. The Col·legi de les Teresianes is no exception, and this can be seen in the use of <strong>parabolic arches</strong> and the religious decorations on the <br /> building’s exterior. The <strong>spiral columns</strong>, wrought ironwork and <strong>four-armed crosses</strong> (three dimensional crosses) are also the personal stamp of the Catalan genius.</p>

<p>With their ornamental fountains, rows of enormous trees, numerous sculptures and plants from <strong>French landscape gardening</strong> of the 20th century, it is no surprise that the Joan Maragall Gardens are considered to be among the most elegant in Barcelona. What&#8217;s more, they surround the Neoclassical <strong>Albéniz</strong> Palace, the official residence of the royal family on their visits to Barcelona.</p>
<p> Designed by Jean-Claude-Nicolas&nbsp;Forestier in 1929 for the Barcelona International Exposition, the Joan Maragall Gardens are a place of serenity where silence and the gentle bubbling water are the main sounds. The extensive lawns with typical Mediterranean trees such as olives and holm oaks are interspersed with more exotic species such as Cycas revoluta. The granite sand paths enable us to explore the garden and its different corners. At the main entrance, a large avenue of magnolias featuring a large pond with water jets in the centre lead to the foot of the hill in front of the palace. Above, a semicircular square, surrounded by Cyprus trees and dominated by the <strong>Statue of Serena</strong> is the antechamber to a small amphitheatre.</p>
<h3>Music and poetry</h3>
<p>The palace, also built in 1929 by Joan Moya,is a neo-classical style building of great architectural value that was remodelled and refurbished in 1970, giving it the appearance it has today. The palace is named after the musician Isaac Albéniz, as, for a while, the option of establishing the Museum of Music there was considered, although in the end this did not happen. Also in 1970, the gardens were extended and became known as the Joan Maragall Gardens, in honour of the <strong>Catalan poet</strong>.</p>
<p> Walking through these <strong>royal parks</strong>, which are not always open to the public, is to enter another world, an experience that enables visitors to observe what the man idealised as a <strong>paradise on earth</strong>.</p>

The big brand names can be found side by side with local-designer footwear and clothes shops as well as unique and specialist stores, many of which go back a hundred years, living monuments to previous eras: candle merchants, such as <strong>Abella</strong>, on <strong>C/ Boters</strong>, and <strong>Subirà</strong> and <strong>Codina</strong>, on <strong>Baixada de la Llibreteria</strong>; full-range knife shops such as the ones in <strong>Plaça del Pi</strong> and C/ <strong> Call </strong>and C/ <strong>Ferran</strong>; boutiques dedicated to selling <i>espardenyes</i> [traditional rope-soled shoes], such as <strong>Manual Alpargatera</strong>, where this typical Catalan footwear is still made by hand; shops specialising in prints and religious items, gloves and hats, such as the glovers <strong>Guanteria Alonso</strong>, on <strong>C/ Santa Anna</strong> and the milliners <strong>Mil</strong>, on <strong>C/ Fontanella</strong> and <strong>Obach</strong>, on <strong>C/ Call</strong>.

Built along with the palace at the end of the 19th century by the architect <strong>August Font i Carreras</strong>, commissioned by the businessman Josep Gallart Forgas, the gardens feature tall palm trees along with other trees such as magnolias, acacias, cedars, orange trees, holm oaks, etc. Experiencing the full splendour of the gardens in springtime is a <strong>delight to the senses</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The French and Italian Renaissance-style garden</strong>, designed by Adrià Piera, is structured around three terraces, the highest being home to the palace and the first garden. The second and third &#8211; which is the largest &#8211; are the ones with the greatest <strong>landscape value</strong>, thanks to their leafy trees and numerous flower beds.</p>
<p><strong>A hidden palace</strong> From the entrance to the park, the palace can be seen in the distance, lost among the palm trees, with two stairways that lead down to the garden. Built in the style of a French <strong><em>château</em></strong>, it has four cylindrical towers with conical peaks. Standing guard over the facade of the building are a group of sculptures which are an allegory of <strong>Les Heures</strong> by Josep Campeny.</p>
<p>Official residence of the Gallart family until the Civil War, for a while the palace was home to the president of the Generalitat, <strong>Lluís Companys</strong>. Later it became the property of <strong>Barcelona Provincial Council</strong> for public use, before becoming the <strong>Bosch i Gimpera</strong> University Foundation, linked to the University of Barcelona.</p>

<h3>A truly local multinational company</h3>
<p>The relationship between the publishing house and the Coll neighbourhood, where it was established, became so close that their <strong>growth </strong>cannot be explained separately. Many Coll residents worked at Bruguera and several local neighbourhood businesses depended on the publishing house either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Bruguera giant dissolved in 1986 due to serious economic difficulties. Today, the building that housed the first workshops is home to the <strong>El Coll – La Bruguera Civic Centre, </strong>a popular centre that is fighting to keep alive the memories of a time when characters such as Zipi and Zape, Doña Urraca, Rompetechos or Superlópez were the indisputable kings of the newsagent’s kiosk.</p>
<p>The project to recover the historical memory of the former Bruguera publishing house is being promoted by the Gràcia district. The aim is to recover and preserve <strong>the oral and documentary heritage</strong> of its former workers and to share this heritage through the active participation of several local associations that organise exhibitions or roundtable discussions. </p>

Covering almost five hectares, and boasting an exceptional array of colours, you find flower-beds of irises, tulips, narcissus flowers and hyacinths, among other flowers, along with eucalyptus, poplars, magnolias. Their flowering seasons are March to April and from the end of July to early September and with each season the flowers change colour and have a different charm, depending on the time of year.</p>

The water runs down from a small, <strong>elongated pond</strong>, and a <strong>wooden bridge </strong>completes this delicate corner where the entrance to the park is located. At the bottom of the stairway is a lake and an <strong>enormous meadow </strong>scattered with large trees, that joins these gardens to those of Joan Brossa. There are also two <strong>female sculptures </strong>in the gardens: the <em>Noia dels Lliris</em> by Ramon Sabi and <em>Maternitat </em>by Sebastià Badia.

<p>Bar Marsella is associated with <strong>Hemingway</strong>, maybe because he was the drinking establishment&#8217;s most famous patron, but it was also the haunt of other artists such as <strong>Dalí, Picasso and Gaudí</strong>. The bar has been a success throughout its two-hundred-year history. It is located at the junction between <strong>Sant Pau and Sant Ramon streets</strong>, in the heart of the Raval neighbourhood and still retains its original bohemian spirit: period lights still hang from its ceiling, there are age-old bottles covered with a solid layer of dust and cobwebs are draped everywhere. Entering is such as <strong>stepping back in time</strong>. December 2013 saw the Marsella&#8217;s future at stake: the building&#8217;s owners wanted the bar manager to leave the premises, but Barcelona City Council used its right to first refusal, buying the property and saving the manager&#8217;s job.</p>
<h3>The absinthe bar</h3>
<p>Still today you can order this <strong>drink that bears some resemblance to anise </strong>but with a super-high alcohol content. The drink was particularly <strong>popular</strong> among artists <strong>in Paris at the end of the 19th century</strong>: it seems to have been an aid to inspiration. Drinking it requires a special ritual: it is served with a bottle of water, a sugar lump and a fork. Only the most audacious know why.</p>

<p>In the middle of Barcelona&#8217;s metropolitan area, extending along four of the city&#8217;s districts, rises the Collserola range, a <strong>typically Mediterranean forest </strong>of pines, oaks and holm oaks, together with a great <strong>diversity of fauna</strong>, just a stone&#8217;s throw from the built-up area. Take a trip into this natural world that can easily be reached by train, and even bus, from the city.

<p>The Collserola range <strong>natural park</strong> has been a <strong>protected area</strong> since 1987, and nine municipalities are involved in preserving it and educating people about it. Going to the <strong>Les Planes picnic area</strong>, taking a trip along Passeig de les Aigües or delving into the woods to look for asparagus are typical snapshots of daily life in Barcelona.</p>
<h3>City and nature merge</h3>
<p>Even though it is predominantly <strong>virgin territory</strong>, the Collserola range has small <strong>residential centres</strong> that belong to the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district and which make up the only real residential zones in this part of Collserola: just above Passeig de les Aigües is <strong>Vallvidrera</strong>, followed a little further in, on a slope, by the village of <strong>Les Planes</strong> and, finally, there is the urban development around <strong>Tibidabo</strong>, the smallest in this part of the mountains. Collserola is present in other neighbourhoods in Barcelona, too, like <strong>Valcarca i els Penitents</strong> (in the Gràcia district) and <strong>Sant Genís dels Agudells</strong>, <strong>Montbau</strong> and <strong>Horta</strong> (in the Horta-Guinardó district).</p>
<p>Collserola means escaping so quickly and directly from the city that the asphalt under your feet changes to soil almost before you notice. A stone&#8217;s throw from Barcelona, contact with nature, the forests and the animals is easy.</p>

<p><strong>Blessed Petra de San José</strong>, founder of the congregation and promoter of this and many other centres all over the country, died in the chapel of the sanctuary in 1906.

<p>Plaça de Llucmajor is at the junction formed by Passeig de Valldaura, Passeig de Verdum and Via Júlia. It is one of the <strong>nerve centres</strong> of the Nou Barris district. The square was remodelled in 1990, with a design that included a <strong>central roundabout</strong> and a large, abstract steel sculpture with a specific purpose: to create, at last, a place for the <em>La República</em> sculpture.</p>
<p>In the centre a large monolith accompanies a 4.5 m <strong>bronze statue</strong> called <strong><em>Flame,</em></strong> created by the sculptor Josep Viladomat. The nude figure of a tall young woman with one arm raised and a laurel branch in her hand, is a symbol of freedom and the future. At the base is a <strong>medallion</strong> by the sculptor Joan Pié with the face in <strong>relief of Pi i Margall</strong>, who became president of the First Spanish Republic in 1873.</p>
<h3>Historical memory</h3>
<p>Both pieces have a long history that goes back to before they were even made. In 1915 the City Council decided to draw up plans for a <strong>sculptural ensemble</strong> dedicated to the Republic and in honour of Pi i Margall to be placed near the obelisk at the centre of the square that was then called Plaça del <strong>Cinc d’Ors</strong>, at the Passeig de Gràcia-Avinguda Diagonal crossroads. But the sculpture did not materialise until the arrival of the <strong>Second Republic</strong>. The president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Lluís Companys, unveiled it on 12 April 1936 but, after the <strong>Civil War</strong>, the Franco regime ordered the statue and the medallion to be removed and destroyed. Thanks to the architects Adolf Florensa and Joaquim Vilaseca, however, they were hidden in a municipal garage and survived. They stayed there until the restoration of <strong>democracy</strong>, when they began their new life. First they were put in Plaça de Sóller, before being installed in Plaça de Llucmajor, their <strong>definitive location</strong>, tailored to a neighbourhood and people that have adopted them and turned them into a symbol.</p>

They are also involved in <strong>education</strong> through the Curriculum Diversification programme, promoted by the Education Consortium.</p>

<p>Now one of <strong>Nou Barris</strong> most iconic symbols, Torre Baró Castle stands between the Roquetes and Torre Baró neighbourhoods. The name &#8220;Torre Baró&#8221; actually comes from another &#8220;torre&#8221; that no longer exists and stood on the site of the metro station, a mansion that belonged to Baron Pinós, the <strong>Baró de Pinós</strong> in Catalan, until it was destroyed in 1714 during the War of the Spanish Succession.</p>
<h3>A privileged viewpoint</h3>
<p>Despite its medieval appearance, the <strong>Castell de Torre Baró</strong>, which dominates the neighbourhood, was built at the start of the 20th century. It was part of a plan to create a hotel at the centre of an <strong>urban development in the area</strong>, but the plan did not work and was abandoned before the building work was finished. Finally, in 1989, it was restored and declared a <strong>historical heritage</strong> site by Barcelona City Council, with a magnificent viewpoint being built round it.</p>
<p>Today it is a <strong>Parc de Collserola</strong> environmental education and information point. Among other activities, it offers guided tours of the castle, itineraries for discovering the surrounding area and education workshops for all ages. It is one of the best viewing points in Barcelona, offering visitors the chance to look out over Nou Barris, Horta, Sant Andreu, Sant Martí and, beyond them, <strong>the River Besòs</strong> and the foothills of Collserola, with the towns of Santa Coloma, Sant Adrià and Badalona.</p>

<p>Early in the 19th century, the utopian socialist Étienne Cabet imagined an island, Icaria, recalling the Greek island of the same name and the flight of Icarus in Greek mythology, where machines would do the laborious tasks instead of men. Later the urban planner Ildefons Cerdà, who realised his own utopian city dream in the Barcelona Eixample, applied this suggestive name to the old path that led to the Poblenou cemetery, then surrounded by factories.</p>
<p>For decades the area now taken up by Nova Icària Beach was known as <strong>Somorrostro</strong>, a shantytown housing thousands of families in terrible conditions. When that disappeared at the end of the 1960s, the area was left abandoned until Cerdà&#8217;s dream came true with the <strong>Barcelona &#8217;92 Olympics</strong>. Nova Icària was reclaimed and turned into one of the beaches that locals prize the most.</p>

<p>The swimming baths, which have long gone, had pools and solariums. They were private and reserved for wealthy families. On the Sant Sebastià and Barceloneta beaches were some very popular swimming baths, among them the Senyora Tona, Sant Sebastià, Orientals and Neptú baths. They all offered users the chance to <strong>enjoy the water</strong> in an <em>appropriate</em> manner, as social conventions regarding bathing in public at that time were very restrictive. Despite that, Sant Sebastià Beach saw the first <strong>mixed bathing area</strong>, where men and women could swim together.</p>
<p>It was here that the city&#8217;s two most important swimming clubs were founded as well. They are still going but they have merged to form the <strong>Club Natació Atlètic-Barceloneta</strong>, a centre that has been a pioneer in water sports for a century.</p>
<h3>21st century beaches</h3>
<p>In the run-up to the 1992 Olympic Games, the beaches were cleaned up and modernised. As a result, Barcelona gained <strong>kilometres of beaches</strong> and reclaimed a large public space accessible to everyone.</p>

It is <strong>fully equipped</strong> for people with disabilities or reduced mobility to enjoy the sea without risk, with specially-adapted facilities like showers, toilets and access points, touch signs, and so on.</p>

You can also get a bite to eat and something to drink at one of the many beach bars, cafes and restaurants.</p>
<p>As well as all this, Barceloneta has another important feature: standing right in the middle of the beach is Rebecca Horn&#8217;s rusty sculpture, <strong><em>L’estel ferit</em></strong>, or <strong><em>The Wounded Star</em></strong>, known locally as &#8220;els cubs&#8221; (the cubes). It cuts a solitary figure against the blue background of the sea and the sky, and turns this space into a symbol of the city.</p>
<h3>From Don Quijote to the Olympics</h3>
<p>At the start of the 17th century, when the Barceloneta neighbourhood was not yet in existence, much of this area was <strong>flooded by the sea</strong>. Over time, as a result of a build up of sand and construction in the port, the city reclaimed the land from the sea and was able to expand on this side too. Around 1600, though, the future Barceloneta beach was still quite a long way out and probably very inhospitable.</p>
<p>It was on that primitive beach that <strong>Cervantes</strong> set the famous, final duel between Quijote and Knight of the White Moon. So it was here on the Mediterranean coast that the poor Quijote had the last of his delirious adventures.</p>
<p>Nearly four centuries later, the beach at Barceloneta had been totally transformed and was ready to show itself to the world during the <strong>1992 Olympics</strong>.</p>

<p>With its four centuries of existence, Port Vell is the oldest part of the Port of Barcelona, and it is still in use today. It was the city&#8217;s <strong>first stable quay</strong>, where ships could dock to shelter from storms, and it effectively separated the city from the water.<br />
Created by scraping sand from the land to the sea, the construction of the port signified Barcelona&#8217;s opening up to other lands. It is this port that has given Barcelona, over the centuries, a common identity with other Mediterranean port cities: commercial, advanced, and a little bit roguish.</p>
<h3>A walk to the shore of the water</h3>
<p>Port Vell, now remodelled and converted into a seafront promenade that has won over the locals, extends from the imposing Gothic <strong>Drassanes Reials</strong>, the royal shipyards, to the <strong>Llotja de Mar</strong> exchange, an impressive Neoclassical building that hides inside it the remains of the old, Gothic-style Llotja. In between, at the <strong>Portal de la Pau</strong>, from where Columbus shows us the way to the Indies, there are new promenades over the water, such as the large, raisable walkway that joins this point to the modern <strong>Maremàgnum </strong>shopping centre. Contemporary art has also claimed this spot, and while on the land side there are works by <strong>Roy Lichtenstein </strong>and<strong> Xavier Mariscal</strong>, floating on the sea are sculptures by <strong>Jaume Plensa</strong>.<br />
But if there is something that steals the hearts of locals and visitors alike, it is <strong>the &#8220;golondrines&#8221;</strong>, recreational boats that for more than 125 years have been offering trips on the Mediterranean waters from Barcelona&#8217;s Port Vell, and which allow you a privileged view of the city from the sea.</p>

<p>For many years, Parc de la Creueta del Coll was <strong>an old stone quarry in</strong> the Coll neighbourhood, in the foothills of Collserola. This urban garden was converted into a <strong>leisure area</strong> for the public in the 1980s, partly thanks to popular action. It houses an impressive massive sculpture weighing 54 tons made of reinforced concrete suspended over a lake by four steel cables which was designed specifically for the site by the artist Eduardo Chillida. Entitled <em>Elogi de l’aigua</em>, the work is based on the myth of Narcissus who fell in love with his own reflection.</p>
<p>But what has won the hearts of the public is the <strong>huge lake</strong> in the shape of a crescent which was transformed into a pool for use by the public during the summer months, and is surrounded by tiered seating and terraces. A shallow pool that allows you to put up with the heat of the Barcelona summer.</p>
<p>It is also a pool in which to enjoy <strong>nature surrounded by art</strong>, as apart from swimming, one can admire the different works of art in the park: apart from the Chillida sculpture, visitors have the opportunity to contemplate the work by Ellsworth Kelly entitled <em>Totem</em> or the <em>Sol i Lluna</em> by Montserrat Altet.</p>
<p>Parc de la Creueta del Coll, which has an <strong>extension of almost two hectares</strong>, is fully accessible thanks to its ramps system, which permits easy access to any part.</p>

<p>Passeig de Gràcia is one of the <strong>most elegant and stately avenues in the city</strong>. It runs through the heart of the Eixample, where back in the early 20th century Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie filled it with magnificent buildings that still marvel visitors today. <strong>Just treasure the architectural gems</strong>, such as Casa Milà, also known as the Pedrera, or Quarry, and Casa Batlló, two houses built by the Modernista architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, and another two Modernista mansions, Casa Amatller i Fuster and Casa Lleó Morera, designed respectively by <strong>Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong> and <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong>.</p>
<h3>An exclusive avenue</h3>
<p>It was called <i>Camí de Jesús</i> (Jesus Way), in times gone by, and was a rough country road that linked the city with the then small town of Gràcia. In 1906, the architect <strong>Pere Falqués</strong> took on the job of designing the avenue and you can still sit on his <strong>spectacular white mosaic</strong> <strong>benches</strong> which also serve as the base of the prettiest lampposts in the city. The paving is another unmistakable sign of his work: the <strong><i>panots</i></strong>, or hexagonal tiles, designed by <strong>Gaudí </strong>in 1904 and decorated with floral motifs, which the city restored at the end of the last century as a tribute to this most international of Catalan architects. Today Passeig de Gràcia is <strong>one of the city&#8217;s most exclusive shopping hubs</strong> and home to an upmarket range of shops, restaurants and hotels.</p>

<p>The industrial past of the <strong>La Sagrera</strong> neighbourhood is strongly linked to the old <strong>Hispano-Suiza</strong> factory, which later became the <strong>ENASA</strong> factory. The Hispano-Suiza car factory acquired the Industrial Harinera Barcelonesa company’s buildings in 1902, extending its facilities to manufacture luxury and racing cars. Hispano-Suiza cars became the most elegant and prestigious in the first three decades of the 20th century. Spain’s Francoist government nationalised Hispano-Suiza in 1946, giving it the name ENASA. The factory continued to manufacture vehicles until 1970, under the <strong>Pegaso</strong> brand and produced the famous Pegaso lorries.<br />
Once it closed its doors, the local people reclaimed the land for the neighbourhood and made this space, previously traversed by workers, a large park open to everyone. In Carrer de la Sagrera the doorway to the factory still remains standing, and it is now the main entrance to the neighbourhood&#8217;s green lung.</p>
<h3>Walk and take a break</h3>
<p>Inside, the shade of the palm trees shelters a series of brick benches that invite you to read or relax before entering the world outside. The park&#8217;s lush vegetation and a canal that begins its journey just beyond the door promise a cool, enchanting route. The paths that open up between wooded areas, esplanades surrounded by plane trees, pergolas and blooming flowerbeds are some of the surprises that the park offers.</p>
<p>Amongst the most unique highlights is <strong>a lake </strong>separating the two spaces which the park is divided into, the lower and the upper zones, formed by <strong>small hills </strong>that pay tribute to the gardens designed in the late nineteenth century by the architect <strong>Josep Fontserè</strong>. A sports centre and various children&#8217;s playground areas guarantee that the park is a place where everyone can enjoy their free time.</p>
<h3>The old factory</h3>
<p>In La Sagrera, the Hispano-Suiza company, nationalised in 1946 and converted into ENASA, left a significant mark in the history of the neighbourhood and in the lives of many residents who worked there. Luxury and racing Hispano-Suiza cars came from this factory, as did the famous Pegaso trucks later on. Only the doorway on Carrer Gran de la Sagrera, which gives access to the Parc de la Pegaso, and the old office building, currently used for local authority facilities, still stand today. In the 50s and 60s, workers from the company Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A. (ENASA), known as Pegaso, staged a series of protests to demand wage increases and bet­ter working conditions. These protests were one of the strong­est oppositions against the Franco regime. In 1956, the work­ers called a new strike to demand the 8-hour workday, a living wage and unemployment benefits. Reprisals did not take long to come: Pegaso closed temporarily, salaries were suspended and layoffs took place. Workers at Pegaso demanded a collec­tive agreement in 1962, which had been requested in 1958. This demand ended up in the closure of the factory for 15 days and the dismissal of four workers. The factory moved to the Zona Franca area of Barcelona in 1971. The Parc de la Pegaso can currently be found where the factory used to be, alongside the old entrance to the factory and various public facilities. A plaque recalls the struggle of the workers who opposed the Franco regime, fighting for the freedoms and rights of workers.</p>

It had several rooms: a dining room, kitchen, meeting room, work shop, garage, library, clinic, bathrooms, theatre and a church. Its 16 interior gardens created a relaxing environment. Men were housed on its right and women on its left. Patients were also grouped according to their social status, sickness and the age. Two religious orders took care of the patients; men were cared for by   Santa Cruz monks and women by Santa Cruz nuns.<br />Some areas were knocked down in the 1970s to make way for parks in Barcinova and Calinova. The centre&#8217;s last patients left in 1987.

The park extends along a <strong>terraced area with concrete steps </strong>that lead down to a large artificial lake. Here, a prominent statue of Neptune by Manuel Fluxà stands guard over the water, which is one of the <strong>four elements</strong> that inspired the park, along with earth, fire and air.

Beyond the lake, willows, oaks, plane trees and cypresses make the park a <strong>bucolic landscape</strong> that is ideal for reading, picnicking or just relaxing.</p>
<h3>Building on the past</h3>
<p>Designed by <strong>architects Luis Peña Ganchegui</strong>,<strong> Antón Pagola and Montserrat Ruiz</strong> in 1985,the park is a modern space that stands on land that used to belong to the country’s leading cotton company, l’Espanya Industrial, which gives the park its name. The factory that stood there from the middle of the nineteenth century (commonly known as El Vapor Nou) was <strong>extremely important</strong> for the neighbourhood, as it provided work for 2,500 people in 1880 and remained operational until 1972. Some of the old factory facilities are now used for social purposes, such as the <strong>Casa del Mig </strong>youth information centre.</p>

<p>The history of the building which today houses the Sants-Montjuïc district offices dates back to the mid-19th century, when the <strong>local residents of Hostafrancs</strong>, which was already part of the city of Barcelona, petitioned the council for a municipal building where they could undertake administrative procedures without having to go to Plaça de Sant Jaume. The result was the <strong>Tinença d’Alcaldia d’Hostafrancs</strong>, the Deputy Mayor&#8217;s seat, which immediately had to be enlarged with the construction, in 1885, of the building designed by the Modernista architect Jaume Gustà i Bondia, which is still standing today. The annexing of the former town of Sants in 1897 meant that the Tinença d’Alcaldia building started to serve the entire new district, and it soon required a further extension. Work was resumed between 1908 and 1915, at the hands of Ubaldo Iranzo i Eiras, and it was at this time that the Noucentista windows were incorporated into the Sala de Plens.</p>
<h3>The Sala de Plens</h3>
<p>With a lavishly decorated facade, principally featuring floral elements, the interior of the building is particularly special. The <strong>Modernista style</strong> of the City Hall&#8217;s Sala de Plens, with a mosaic floor, capitals sculpted with female figures, iron beams and a ceiling decorated with floral sgraffito, contrasts with the large Noucentista stained glass windows that flood the space with colour. Made in 1914 by Francesc Labarta i Plana, they depict <strong>everyday scenes </strong>of industry, commerce and agriculture, the typical activities of the district&#8217;s residents at that time<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>The history of Ateneu Popular 9 Barris began in 1977 when the locals fought to reclaim an <strong>old asphalt plant</strong> and turn it into a <strong>sociocultural centre</strong>. Since then, the Ateneu’s work has been related to <strong>artistic and social activities</strong> under the management of the Associació Bidó de Nou Barris, and it has become a model for the whole of Barcelona.</p>
<h3>The circus as an emblem</h3>
<p>One of the main goals of Ateneu Popular 9 Barris since its beginnings has been to provide artistic and social training in <strong>a number of disciplines</strong>, with a special focus on the circus. This work started off with workshops and it was consolidated through the creation of the <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>Infantil de Circ </strong>(Children’s Circus School) in 1984 and the <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>Juvenil de Circ</strong> (Youth Circus School) in 2003. The centre has also hosted the <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>de Circ Rogelio Rivel</strong> (Rogelio Rivel Circus School) since 1999, which offers a two-year programme designed to train circus professionals.</p>
<p>The desire to spread popular culture and the fact that it hosts a theatre have also made it an <strong>essential setting</strong> for quality shows from national and international circus companies, and locals pay affordable prices to attend these.</p>
<p>Ateneu Popular 9 Barris has also been putting on its own productions since 1996, when it created the emblematic <strong>Circ d’Hivern</strong> (Winter Circus). This initiative allows professional companies to stage shows that have not been done before and means <strong>a new show every Christmas.</strong> The work this influential centre does earned it the 2015 Barcelona Medal of Honour.</p>

<h3>Tribute to a Catalan artist</h3>
<p>Created in 1979 by a group <strong>of young architects</strong> led by Beth Galí, Parc Joan Miró covers the site of what was formerly the <strong>Barcelona Abattoir</strong>.Its straight structure surrounds a square where all types of events are held.The <strong>woodland areas</strong> include black poplars, pines,palm trees and holm oaks.

<p>The Turó de la Peira park is not just another park, it feels more like a wood. It lies in the Nou Barris district and can be reached from the Can Peguera and Turó de la Peira neighbourhoods that surround it, embrace it and almost keep it a secret. It is spread over nearly <strong>eight hectares</strong>, and delving into its <strong>leafy pine grove</strong> and enjoying the smell of Mediterranean vegetation encourages you to forget you are in a city.</p>
<p>It opened as a public park in 1936, under the Second Republic, and it occupies the site of an old quarry that had belonged to the Marchioness of Castellbell. In 1977 it was expanded and given a new layout before being completely renovated in 2007, when it acquired its current size and the new facilities it has today.</p>
<h3>Climb to the top</h3>
<p>The park winds its way up the hill it is named after in a <strong>spiral of circular paths</strong> that take you to the top. There are also stone steps that let you climb there in a straight line. Along the way are <strong>resting places</strong>, with benches, platforms, children&#8217;s playgrounds and picnic areas. The scenery gradually changes as the lower part, predominantly <strong>landscaped and grassy</strong>, gives ways to the <strong>leafy pine grove</strong> higher up.</p>
<p>Whichever path you take, they all lead to the summit 140 metres above sea level, dominated by a cross and with an impressive viewpoint. Getting there is a real treat because it offers some unique, 360º views of the city, and you can see the Collserola and the sea at the same time.</p>

<p>The estate was in a poor state of repair during the early 1970s, so the <strong>Joan Maragall Residents Association</strong> reclaimed it for the neighbourhood. Finally, <strong>two hectares</strong> were restored as a public park which opened as Les Aigües Park.</p>
<h3>Fruit and ornamental trees</h3>
<p>The vegetation that grows in the park includes a great variety of fruit trees, such as <strong>orange and fig trees</strong> <strong>that are exceptional </strong>for the age and textures of their trunks.

The more than <strong>230 species of plants </strong>and the exceptional tranquility of the space make these gardens a unique place.</p>
<p>Divided into <strong>two levels </strong>joined by a large <strong>stone stairway</strong>, the gardens are home to an extensive variety of flower beds, with creepers and trees that are unique to each of them, and with a sign displaying the name of each plant so visitors do not miss anything. Among the <strong>more curious species </strong>are the Goldenrain tree from China which is located right at the entrance to the garden, a ziziphus shrub, a white ball acacia, a strawberry myrtle and many more.</p>
<h3>A symbolic olive tree</h3>
<p>As well as the numerous species of flora found in the garden, it is also home to other valuable features, such as the <strong>Barcelona AIDS Memorial</strong> which was inaugurated in 2003 and was designed by gardener Lluís Abad. The memorial project was presented to Parks and Gardens by the NGO Projecte dels Noms, set up in 1993 to promote public awareness of AIDS. It is an olive tree, the <strong>symbol of peace and eternity</strong>, which stands in a flower bed with elongated paving stones on which a poem by Miquel Martí i Pol has been engraved.</p>

<p>In the foothills of Montjuïc near the emblematic Teatre Grec there stands the <strong>Ciutat del Teatre</strong>, the city of theatre, where the Institut del Teatre has been located since the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
<p>This institute is the oldest dance and theatre training centre in Barcelona. It was set up in 1913 by <strong>Adrià Gual</strong> under the name <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>Catalana d’Art Dramàtic</strong> (Catalan School of Dramatic Arts), to make culture an institution and to modernise the Catalan theatre scene. In 1939 it adopted the name by which it is still known, the Institut del Teatre, and in 1952 it became the <strong>Escola Superior d’Art Dramàtic i Dansa</strong>. At the beginning of the 1980s it set up shop in Carrer de Sant Pere Més Baix in Ciutat Vella, in the building which is now the Espai Bonnemaison, where it trained the <strong>generations of actors</strong> that today tread the boards in the city&#8217;s theatres, and this is where it remained until it moved to its new home in 2000.</p>
<h3>Reflecting creativity</h3>
<p>With this move, the Institut del Teatre also gained a <strong>new status</strong>, that of a centre involved in teaching, culture, research and promotion.</p>
<p>It includes the Escola Superior d’Art Dramàtic, the Conservatori Superior de Dansa, the Escola d’Ensenyament Secundari i Artístic (a theatre school at secondary level) and the Escola Superior de Tècniques de les Arts de l’Espectacle (a college for performing arts technicians). In addition it houses the performing arts archives and museum, the Centre de Documentació i el <strong>Museu de les Arts Escèniques</strong>, which is home to one of the most important collections of documents in Europe, specialising in <strong>Catalan theatre </strong>and the Spanish Golden Age.</p>
<p>To further its founding aim, the Institut del Teatre acts as one of the most important focal points of Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>cultural scene</strong>, offering continual samples of the work being developed by the next generation in the world of performing arts. For this reason, in 1996 the dance company <strong>IT Dansa</strong> was set up, which helps young dancers bring their projects to the public, as well as <strong>Festival NEO</strong> (Noves Escenes Obertes), which is a platform raising the profile of new artists in the world of theatre today.</p>

<p>Parc de Cervantes is a large <strong>green space </strong>filled with lawns and trees that has two entrances: Avinguda Diagonal, which is the main entrance, and a more hidden entrance, via the Ronda de Dalt. Throughout the year it is common to find people jogging or riding bike here, or simply going for a walk and resting on the benches. However, the real show begins with the arrival of spring when its more than <strong>10,000 rose bushes </strong>come into bloom and fill the four-hectare park with an array of <strong>colours and scents</strong>.</p>
<p>Classified and divided into carefully arranged flower beds, the ideal way to discover the roses and <strong>enjoy their splendour </strong>is to take a gentle stroll along the lawns that demarcate them and if you go bear foot, even better. This <strong>botanical circuit </strong>enables you to travel across four continents and to learn about the difficult art of <strong>cultivating roses</strong>.</p>
<h3>Place of traditions</h3>
<p>Each year the <strong>Barcelona New Roses </strong>competition is held in the park. Since 2001 this competition has been attempting to revive the city&#8217;s <strong>rose-growing tradition</strong>, which began in the early part of the 20th century. The garden is located on the land previously occupied by the <strong>Estela</strong> stream, into which the water from the top of <strong>Sant Pere Màrtir</strong> used to flow. The architectural and artistic value of the park lies in a series of <strong>sculptures</strong>, such as the <strong><em>Rombes Bessons</em></strong> by Andreu Alfaro, and the female nude <em>Serenitat</em>, made by Eulàlia Fàbregues de Sentmenat. Parc de Cervantes is the only one of its kind in Barcelona and it has all the attractions of a green space, providing the district with <strong>peace and tranquility </strong>and <strong>place to relax</strong>, but it also boasts a <strong>real gem </strong>in the form of the <strong>rose gardens </strong>that are not to be missed.</p>

<p>The highlights of the gardens are the two pieces by Antoni Gaudí: a <strong>lath house</strong> —a pergola covered in climbing plants— and the Font d’Hèrcules, the fountain of Heracles, which the Catalan architect created for Eusebi Güell. The <strong>Font d’Hèrcules</strong> is located in a bamboo copse, and has a wrought iron spout in the shape of a dragon&#8217;s head from where the water flows.For many years it remained hidden by vegetation, and was only discovered in 1984 during cleaning work.</p>

<p>A modern artistic twist is provided by the <i>Kolonihaven</i>, a children&#8217;s play house designed by architects Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue to celebrate the European cultural capital, Copenhagen. But the park is home to <strong>other sculptures</strong>, like <i>Nu femení agenollat </i>(Nude female kneeling), by Joan Borrell i Nicolau; <i>Mediterrània </i>(Mediterranean) by Eulàlia Fàbregas de Sentmenat, and <i>Nu </i>(Nude) a bronze by Enric Casanovas (1930).</p>
<p>The origin of the gardens goes back to a fire that in 1875 destroyed the <strong>royal family&#8217;s Barcelona residence</strong>, situated in the flat area of the Palau.

<p>The construction of Mercat del Clot should be seen in the context of the powerful growth of Barcelona during the <strong>nineteenth century,</strong> and the subsequent need to provide the various neighbourhoods and adjacent towns with functional buildings suitable for accommodating markets. Following the <strong>trends in</strong> <strong>London and Paris </strong>(particularly Les Halles), Barcelona City Council decided to establish a network of markets that were characterised by a common structure: <strong>a metal frame with bare brick walls</strong>.</p>
<p>The architect responsible for the design of Mercat del Clot was <strong>Pere Falqués</strong>, who made it almost identical to another nearby market, Mercat del Poblenou. Both markets became not only vital trade centres and meeting points in the <strong>Sant Martí district</strong>, but also emblematic examples of a type of building typical of Modernista Barcelona.</p>
<h3>Cathedrals of the Mediterranean diet</h3>
<p>The sale of local, fresh and quality produce, the personal service and the professionalism of the people who work there make the markets authentic temples for a <strong>healthy diet</strong>. The Municipal Institute of Markets (IMMB) was established in Barcelona in 1991with the aim of preserving and promoting a <strong>market culture in the city</strong>. As a result, at Mercat del Clot and many others, activities are organised that go beyond mere buying and selling, and include such initiatives as workshops and talks on cooking and food, exhibitions, itineraries, etc. For example, during El Clot <em>festa major </em>local festivities, the market organises a <strong>“Nit de Tapes” </strong>(Tapas Night), as do many of the city’s municipal markets, live music, lucky draws, special offers and other events.</p>

<p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Barcelona City Council promoted the construction of <strong>covered markets </strong>to regulate the many street vendor who set up their stalls in the open air all around the city. In those times, Sant Andreu de Palomar was still an <strong>independent township,</strong> and local farmers continued to gather in Plaça de Marcadal to sell their wares directly to local residents.</p>
<p>When, in 1897, Sant Andreu de Palomar became Barcelona’s ninth district, the City Council decided to provide it with a well-equipped, covered, safe facility. The square was therefore roofed by a <strong>steel structure</strong> in 1914, whilst the interior was furnished at a later date.</p>
<h3>Plaça Mercadal</h3>
<p>This square was conceived in the mid-19th century in a neoclassical style with porticos, which were subsequently used for dwellings. It was the cen­tre of commercial life in the old town of Sant Andreu de Palomar. The old Mercat de Sant Andreu (1914) is in the middle of the square.</p>
<h3>Lifelong stalls</h3>
<p>Many of the vendors who work on the stalls at the Mercat de Sant Andreu today are descendants of the <strong>original street sellers</strong>, and some are even fourth or fifth generation stallholders. The <strong>centenary </strong>in 2014 was a celebration that brought a lot of joy to the whole neighbourhood, along with a renewed sense of optimism with which to face the century’s new challenges, including refurbishment of the market itself.</p>

<p>Today, the <strong>modern façade</strong> of Mercat de la Guineuetaand the lattice of <strong>LED lights </strong>that can be seen on Passeig de Valldaura act like a signal beckoning you to come inside.

<p>The market was constructed in response to a need to supply the people who had just arrived in the area at a time when the Guineueta neighbourhood and the rest of the Nou Barris district were growing as a result of the <strong>waves of migration</strong>. Built as a commercial centre selling <strong>fresh produce</strong>, it was the area’s only large space for food shopping until the 1980s and this made it a vital <strong>commercial and social epicentre</strong> for many generations in the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Improvements that all add up</h3>
<p>The renovation of the Mercat de la Guineueta was a <strong>turning point</strong> and it represented a determined, modern leap into the twenty-first century. Led by the architect Daniel Mòdol, the refurbishment involved a significant expansion of the market area, which now measures <strong>6,500 square metres</strong>. Thanks to its <strong>big canopy</strong>,a square was also created opening onto the main entrance at Passeig de Valldaura and it is always bustling with life. </p>
<p>After this makeover and in step with Barcelona’s constant renovation, the shops in the Mercat de la Guineueta have continued to uphold the <strong>long-standing values</strong> of providing top-quality products and offering the best possible service</p>

<p>Parish cemeteries <strong>were banned in 1775</strong> for health reasons. <strong> Isolated or rural graveyards</strong>, such as that of Sant Genís, were spared the ban. The church of Sant Genís dels Agudells is of <strong>Romanesque origin</strong> with vestiges of earlier times, which include a fish, the symbol of the early Christians, engraved into the right-hand-side of the main door. It was extensively renovated in the 17th century. Following its consecration in 932, the parish had a <strong>sanctuary</strong> formed by the church, the cemetery and an area of thirty square feet granted by the bishop which enjoys ecclesiastic protection and immunity.</p>

One of its innovations was the space it reserved for <strong>burying non-Catholics</strong>, Protestants and Jews, for example.

<p>The Market of Les Corts was built in 1961 in an <strong>area that was previously occupied by vegetable gardens. </strong>It was initially built to supply the people of the neighbourhood with fresh food at a time of major expansion in the <strong>neighbourhood of Les Corts</strong>. The structure took the form of the typical arch-roofed buildings of the period. It gradually became an essential part of the neighbourhood as it continued to grow. The market was remodelled In 1993 to help it adapt to the new commercial demands and the increase in the number of customers.</p>
<p>However, the ongoing <strong>modernization </strong>of the city and the neighbourhood of Les Corts resulted in the <strong>Municipal Institute of Markets</strong> deciding to remodel it once again in 2008. This time it underwent a complete reform managed by the company G56.</p>
<h3>Present and future</h3>
<p>The initiative opted for a <strong>radical transformation of the façade</strong>, that opens onto Travessera de les Corts, and the construction of an entrance at street level and a ramp designed to break the architectural barriers, making it <strong>accessible</strong> <strong>to all</strong>.</p>
<p>The stalls were also refurbished but they managed to <strong>keep the cheerful spirit </strong>that have been their hallmark since their beginnings as well as their<strong> essential purpose</strong>: that of offering top quality food. In recent years, the classical range of products on offer has been supplemented by several new proposals, and we can now find stalls that offer <strong>biological products and goods for gourmets</strong>.</p>

<p>The work, which began in 2009 and finished in 2014, was the responsibility of the architectural studio <strong>Pb2 Projecte</strong>, led by the architect Josep Llobet i Bach. The renovations respected the <strong>Modernista features </strong>on the facade so that the building still retains its original essence whilst having been <strong>altered and completely updated </strong>inside.</p>
<p>Each of the fifty stalls has been designed according to the vendors&#8217; wishes and the products they offer. In addition, the market now has <strong>new services</strong>, like parking spaces for 90 customers. The remodelling was also done with sustainability in mind and includes elements making the building a model of energy efficiency, like an air-conditioning system based on groundwater use and lighting with movement sensors, amongst other things.</p>

In fact, it wasn’t long before it adopted the name Mercat del Ninot [“Cabin Boy Market”], which it took from a nearby tavern that was well-known at the time for selling cheap wine. On its door, there was a ship’s figurehead of a cabin boy, which can now be found in Barcelona Maritime Museum.</p>

The use of <strong>metal frames</strong> rather than the traditional stone was one of the biggest changes in Catalan public architecture at the close of the century.</p>
<h3>The building</h3>
<p>The market is rectangular. It is 38 metres wide by 105 metres long, and covers an area of 4,010 square metres. It has three aisles or sections: a large central aisle 13 metres high and two, smaller side aisles. The pitched roof is made from <strong>glazed ceramic</strong> tiles and the walls are bare brick. Together these features make this an important example of <strong>public architecture</strong> from the end of the 19th century, combining Modernisme with the new construction systems.</p>

<h3 class=""title"">History of an iconic market</h3>
<p>Santa Caterina began life as a covered municipal market <strong>in 1845</strong>, on land left by the old convent of the same name, which was burned down on St James Night in 1835 during the confiscation and sale of Church lands. The idea was to give the neighbourhood a market that would supply food to the people living on this side of <strong>Ciutat Vella</strong>. Decades later, during the years following the Civil War, when food was in short supply in many places, the market became a centre for supplying neighbouring cities, such as Sant Adrià, Santa Coloma and even Mataró, from where people came by train to buy groceries.</p>
<p>Today, Santa Caterina is known for the <strong>quality and variety</strong> of its produce. Generally, it attracts fewer visitors than the Boqueria, which makes it more tranquil.</p>

<p>The Barceloneta has traditionally been the city&#8217;s fishing neighbourhood. It was built from scratch in 1753 next to the port and outside the then walled city, and welcomed a large number of citizens soon after. The marine activity of the neighbourhood saw the emergence of a market specialising in fish and shellfish, which initially consisted of outdoor stalls until the construction of a Modernist building during the later part of the 19th century.</p>
<h3>The market of the sea</h3>
<p>The building, designed by Antoni Rovira i Trias, was a comprehensive and functional space and it replaced the traditional open-air stalls. This building remained in use for a number of decades, becoming one of the neighbourhood’s <strong>vital organs, </strong>until the start of the 21st century when it became clear that it would need to be refurbished. The architect Josep Mine, a friend of the late Enric Miralles, was entrusted with the refurbishment of the market. He respected the original wrought-iron structure and the brick walls but he also installed lifts, air conditioning, sewerage, new lighting, underground floors and photovoltaic solar panels, making the market the first in Barcelona to use <strong>solar energy</strong>. There are also two restaurants and an upper level that is used for functions related to the world of food and gastronomy.</p>

It is the city&#8217;s <strong>main train station</strong>, and is considered to be the nerve centre of land transport in Barcelona. Outside the train station there is a <strong>bus station </strong>with the same name.<br /> Its medium and long-distance services, using both the classic and <strong>high-speed</strong> rail networks, connect Barcelona to both national and international destinations.

<h3>Platforms from the past and present</h3>
<p>The history of the station dates back to the old stables of the La Bordeta neighbourhood and Sants station which entered into operation at the <strong>end of 1881</strong>. Following successive changes and business mergers, in 1967 a plan was put in place to build the station we know today. Opened in the 1970s, the materials used in its construction included <strong>steel, concrete and glass</strong>. It is a <strong>modern, functional station </strong>with numerous services and information points, and it is also home to the metro station of the same name, with access to lines 3 and 5. Its suburban rail network connects Barcelona to almost all the surrounding towns, and thousands of people use this form of transport to reach the city centre each day.

<p>The International Exposition, held in Barcelona in 1929, transformed <strong>Montjuïc</strong>, recovering it for public use. One of the numerous legacies from that time is the Montjuïc funicular railway, the <strong>cable transport system </strong>that was opened in 1928 to facilitate access to the mountain.</p>
<p>This <strong>historical mode of transport </strong>connects the city, from Avinguda del Paral·lel, with Avinguda Miramar, where a large number of the Montjuïc&#8217;s sports and cultural facilities are located.</p>
<p>Originally, the funicular railway had a second stretch that took passengers up to the castle, but with the opening of the cable car, this stretch of the railway fell into disuse. Renovated for the first time in 1992 for the Olympic Games, it was the second renovation in 2005 which gave it the modern appearance it has today.</p>
<h3>Climbing the mountain</h3>
<p>The funicular railway operates as part of the metro network and its initial stop is in the Paral·lel metro station itself, where is connects with lines L2 and L3. The second and final stop, the Parc de Montjuïc station, is situated on the mountain, on <strong>Avinguda</strong> <strong>de Miramar</strong>, which extends to Avinguda de l’Estadi, at a height of 80 metres above sea level and is a short distance from the Montjuïc cable car. This is the location of some of the most important cultural amenities in the park, such as the Joan Miró Foundation, the Palau Sant Jordi and the Olympic Stadium. The journey is a real pleasure.</p>

<p>The Atalaya is one of the most characteristic buildings of the so-called <strong>Escola de Barcelona</strong>,  or Barcelona school, an architectural movement developed in Catalonia between 1960 and 1970. The movement is characterised by austerity and elegance and gives a nod to northern Italian architecture from the 1950s and 60s. The common stylistic stamp is the search for structure and logic, simple lines and innovative shapes, with emphasis on interior design and the urban planning surrounding the buildings.</p>

<p>Attached to Casa Batlló, Casa Amatller ;was built by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, one of Antoni Gaudí&#8217;s greatest rivals at the start of the 20th century. The fact that they are touching each other and both are impressive houses, very near Casa Lleó Morera and other magnificent Modernista houses, means this area in the middle of Passeig de Gràcia is still known as the <strong><em>block </em></strong><em><strong>of discord</strong></em>.</p>
<p> The house was built between 1898 and 1900, for the <strong>chocolatier Antoni Amatller</strong> at the time when the Eixample had just opened and bourgeois families from throughout the city decided to adopt <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> as their own residential area.</p>
<h3>A Flemish house</h3>
<p>The building is inspired by 17th century Dutch houses , with a <strong>typically Flemish facade</strong> covered in triangular-shaped ceramics and flat at the top. The lower facade and entrance are decorated with <strong>sculptures by Eusebi Arnau </strong>with typical Catalan motifs, such as Sant Jordi (St George) slaying the dragon, and also in honour of the chocolatier owner, including family surnames and references to his trade.</p>
<p> Apart from being a chocolatier, Amatller was also a photography enthusiast, and his daughter converted the family home into an art centre, the <strong>Institut</strong> Amatller d’Art Hispànic. A selection from her father&#8217;s vast collections is on display on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Built at the <strong>end of the 19th century</strong> for the textile trader Pere Màrtir Calvet, who used part of the building for his business and another as a residence, Casa Calvet is considered by experts as the most conservative work by <strong>the architect Antoni Gaudí</strong>. Since 1994, it is also a well-known restaurant of <strong>Mediterranean cuisine</strong> run by the chef Miquel Alija.</p>
<p>Casa Calvet is located in Carrer Casp, very near Plaça Urquinaona. It is the first of three houses which Antoni Gaudí designed in the <strong>Eixample</strong>.Its <strong>Baroque style</strong> gives it an unusual, austere look and marks a <strong>time of transition</strong> between two stages in the architect&#8217;s career: the first, when he still made personal reinterpretations of different historical styles, and the second, when he showed that he was free from any conditioning factor.</p>
<p>Winner of the annual best building award granted by <strong>Barcelona City Council</strong> in 1900,Casa Calvet stands out for the facade on which Gaudí worked with <strong>Lluís Badia</strong> on the <strong>wrought iron</strong> balconies, and the carpenter Casas i Barde on the woodwork. Built in <strong>dressed stone from Montjuïc</strong>, it is decorated with structures of <strong>religious busts</strong> of Sant Pere Màrtir and the saints of Calvet&#8217;s home town. The main gallery is also profusely decorated with an olive tree as a symbol of peace, a cypress tree as a symbol of hospitality, and the shield of Catalonia.</p>
<h3>Modernista touches</h3>
<p>In spite of its Baroque style,<strong>Modernista features</strong> can be seen on the facade, in the curved shape of the <strong>iron balconies</strong>, the glass balcony which overhangs the entrance and the <strong>columns in the shape of bobbins</strong> which flank the entrance in an allusion to the trader&#8217;s profession.</p>
<p> The <strong>first work by Gaudí in the Eixample</strong> is a unique testimony to his work, which enables you to observe and delight in the<strong> evolution </strong>of his <strong>architecture</strong> over time, and also, if you have the chance,to taste the delicious Mediterranean cuisine.</p>

<p>Despite having some straight lines that have no part in the sinuous curves of <strong>Gaudiesque architecture</strong>, there is no doubting that Bellesguard House is one of the best examples of architectural innovation by the master architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>. Jaume Figueres, a businessman and close friend of Gaudí&#8217;s, wanted to build a house for his family in a unique setting with lots of political significance. So he chose a place in Collserola, where there were the <strong>remains of a medieval castle</strong> that belonged to King Martín the Humane but which, in the 18th century, was home to the highwayman Serrallonga.</p>
<h3>Modernista castle</h3>
<p>Gaudí, impressed by the history of this spot, designed a house inspired by the old castle with some very straight lines, and he made the most of the remains to design the garden of the estate. The result is an <strong>impressive mansion</strong> that resembles a castle with its merlons but has a lot of Gaudiesque touches, such as the use of wrought iron, ceramic mosaic benches, large, colourful glazed windows and brick friezes, as well as a detail that does not escape the curious eye of visitors: the ivy-shaped pipes.</p>
<p>Bellesguard, declared a <strong>Property of Cultural Interest</strong> in 1969, is now open for guided tours, so you can enjoy the majesty of its rooms, the tranquility of its gardens and the spectacular views but, above all, so you can admire close up, one of Gaudí&#8217;s treasures, perhaps the one most hidden from view.</p>

<p>In 1883, the entrepreneur Manel Vicens contacted <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, a young, unknown architect who had just obtained his degree, and asked him to build a summer residence in the <strong>town of Gràcia</strong>. The chosen site was on <strong>Carrer de les Carolines</strong>, next to the convent.</p>
<p>Gaudí designed a building with <strong>Arabic, Mudejar and oriental</strong> elements, in which straight lines took prominence over the architect&#8217;s famous undulating lines, although some of the features that were so typical of his style were then starting to be seen.</p>
<h3>Gaudinian spirit</h3>
<p>Casa Vicens is covered with <strong>green and white tiles</strong> that have yellowish details imitating the carnations that grew in the garden; the entrance doors are made of <strong>cast iron and filigree</strong> and reminiscent of palm leaves; and the arcades, latticework and use of masonry conjure up memories of the Alhambra. Gaudí&#8217;s love of nature starts to be visible, and one can go on a <strong>treasure hunt</strong> to find the phrases, taken from children&#8217;s stories, bordering the friezes inside the house. It is said and in fact, reflected in the original plans of the house, that there was once a fountain in the garden in which the water created a permanent rainbow-like effect, but that fountain no longer exists. Only a genius like Gaudí could have planned such a fountain.</p>
<p>The spectacular Casa Vicens, with its glazed tiles that adorn the facades and its oriental air, was classified as a <strong>UNESCO heritage site </strong>in 2005 and is one of the first works by the unique Antoni Gaudí, in which the characteristics that would make him one of the most original architects ever can still be seen.</p>

<p>In the final third of the <strong>19th century</strong>, universal expositions, or world trade fairs, were events that had an enormous social impact because they introduced the host city to the whole world, along with the cultural, economic, scientific and industrial potential of each country. So the Triumphal Arch was not only the entrance to the <strong>Universal</strong> <strong>Exposition of 1888</strong>, it also symbolically marked Barcelona&#8217;s entry into the <strong>modern era</strong>.</p>
<p>From an urban development perspective, the Arc de Triomf stands on the edge of <strong>Ciutat Vella</strong>, the old city that spreads out to the south, and modern Barcelona outside the old walls to the north, the E<strong>ixample</strong> neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Modernista spirit</h3>
<p>At the height of the <strong>Modernista or Art Nouveau</strong> <strong>movement</strong> in a large part of Europe, it was common to see constructions reflecting a historicist trend, that is, one inspired by previous eras. Neo-Gothic, Neo-Mudéjar (at least in Spain) and Neo-Romantic were some of the predominant styles.</p>
<p>In line with this trend, the architect <strong>Josep Vilaseca</strong> drew up plans for a monument 30 metres high, of classical proportions, but very attractive and highly <strong>symbolic</strong>. The artists who sculpted the decorative friezes portrayed a city-related theme on each side: <em>Barcelona welcomes the nations</em> (on the Passeig de Sant Joan face, by Josep Reynés), <em>Sharing the rewards among the participants of the Exposition </em>(on the Passeig de Lluís Companys face, by Josep Llimona) and allegories of Industry, Agriculture and Trade on one side, and Science and Art on the other.

<p>The origins of the Universitat de Barcelona date back to the <strong>15th century</strong>, when King Alfonso the Magnanimous founded the Estudi General de Barcelona. The university was a very active and very important education centre under the Crown of Aragon until 1714 when, as a result of the <strong>War of Succession,</strong> it was suppressed. In 1838, when at last it could return to the city, it was initially housed in a convent on Carrer del Carme, but the need was immediately seen for a new building.</p>
<p>The project was carried out by the Catalan architect <strong>Elies Rogent</strong> and the site finally chosen to locate the building was in the Eixample, the new part of the city that had just been planned. Construction started in 1862, but it was not completely finished until 1892-93, although classes started in 1871 and it was officially opened in 1874.</p>
<h3>Places of peace and study</h3>
<p>The result was this magnificent <strong>Neoromantic building</strong>, with a facade of 129 metres running along the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, with a raised main building in the centre, and a building on either side. The right-hand building was for science and the left-hand building for the arts.</p>
<p>The central building is entered through a hall with an impressive staircase of honour, which leads to the assembly hall. This is where the Saló de Graus is found, the most emblematic part of the building, with its exuberant decoration in Moorish and Plateresque style. The side buildings hide the <strong>cloisters</strong> with fruit trees and fountains where <strong>silence and calm prevail</strong>.At the back of the building there is a green area known as the <strong>Ferran Soldevila Garden</strong>, as a tribute to this Barcelona historian.It is a little-known, unique place to <strong>relax </strong>and escape from the outside world for a moment.In summer, the university organises various <strong>outdoor events</strong> there, including talks and concerts.</p>
<p>Today, the University of Barcelona is considered to be the best <strong>university research centre</strong> on the Iberian peninsula, for the number of excellent programmes it has achieved in this field.The various university departments are located at different points round the city: Raval,Zona Universitària, Mundet and Bellvitge, plus the <strong>historical centre</strong> in the Eixample,which is still used today for Philology, Literary Studies and Mathematics, and continues to be one of the most <strong>emblematic</strong> institutions of the city, governing most of its cultural life.</p>

It is worth spending a moment contemplating the building itself, starting with its <strong>façade, which is decorated with balconies and pillars </strong>and crowned by an imposing 12-vase balustrade. Rising from the shady courtyard are two majestic staircases, one on either side, which ascend to the main floor of the palace, where temporary exhibitions are held.</p>

Today the complex houses the national library, Biblioteca de Catalunya, as well as other institutions.</p>","<h3>A long history</h3>
<p>In 1401, in the presence of King Martin the Humane, the first stones were laid of the Hospital de la Santa Creu, which was to become the largest hospital centre in Barcelona. In fact, it was built with the idea of bringing the city&#8217;s six existing hospitals together into a single location. The first stage was completed <strong>in 1414</strong> and the hospital started working while the other stages were being carried out.</p>
<p>A century later and the complex was practically finished. Further modifications were made in the 16th century, such as the addition of the two monumental staircases and the plateresque-style door on Carrer de l’Hospital, which became the main entrance. Drinking water was piped there too. In the 17th century another building was attached, namely the <strong>Casa de Convalescència</strong> convalescent home (the building at the northern end, adjacent to Carrer del Carme) and, in the following century a surgery college, the <strong>Col·legi de Cirurgia</strong>, was built.</p>
<h3><strong>From King Martin to the architect Gaudí </strong></h3>
<p>By the end of the 19th century the hospital complex could not provide care for the ever more populous city, nor was it able to adapt to the dynamics of modern medicine. Consequently it was agreed to move it to the newly built Hospital de Sant Pau. After five centuries of medical service, the old hospital closed in 1926, the same year that a seriously injured Antoni Gaudí was admitted and died. He was one of its last patients.</p>
<p>Today, the old Santa Creu Hospital is regarded as one of the most important <strong>civil Catalan Gothic</strong> sites, and its various buildings continue to serve the city. They house the national library, the Biblioteca de Catalunya, as well as the Institut d’Estudis Catalans (IEC &#8211; Institute of Catalan Studies), the Royal Academy of Pharmacy and the Academy of Medicine, with its <strong>anatomical amphitheatre</strong>, a dissecting table that can be visited and which dates from the <strong>18th century</strong>. There is also a school, a theatre, a contemporary art centre and, in the middle of the courtyard, a fountain with a jet where an egg dances, L&#8217;ou com balla, to celebrate the festival of Corpus Christi.</p>

To the south of the monastery is the <strong>small cloister </strong>featuring lobular arches and a variety of columns and capitals where you can go for a walk and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood. The monastery is surrounded by <strong>gardens </strong>of the same name featuring <strong>large lawns </strong>that create a unique and relaxing green space.

<p>The Llotja School has two campuses located in the neighbourhoods of San Andreu and Sarrià. It offers a huge range of intermediate and advanced-level <strong>vocational training courses</strong>, as well as Masters courses focused on the<strong>graphic and design arts </strong>and including four specialities: graphic design, interior design, fashion and product design.</p>
<h3>The History of the Llotja or a Country&#8217;s Art</h3>
<p>Although this school seems radically modern, it has a <strong>long tradition </strong>beginning back in the <strong>18th century, </strong>making it the oldest design school in Spain and one of the oldest in Europe. It was set up in 1775 by Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>Junta Particular de Comerç, </strong>the Chamber of Commerce, and the first classrooms were located on the top floor of the <strong>Llotja de Mar </strong>stock exchange, from where it takes its name.</p>
<p>When the school was founded in the eighteenth century, for lack of a better place, the Barcelona Board of Commerce decided to install the drawing classrooms in the Llotja (market) building located in the Pla de Palau, so the school adopted the name of its first home. The aim was to train <strong>artists</strong> to design patterns for the textile industry, but the school soon grew and it extended its study subjects to other areas. This is how it became the most important producer of artists in Catalonia: <strong>Marià Fortuny</strong>, <strong>Damià Campeny</strong>, <strong>Lola Anglada</strong>, <strong>Joaquim Mir</strong>, <strong>Joan Miró</strong>, <strong>Mercè Llimona</strong> and <strong>Apel·les Mestres</strong> all spent time in its classrooms, as did artists from other places including <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong>, who studied painting there before leaving for Paris.</p>
<p>Currently La Llotja produces hugely important designers, illustrators and other plastic artists who each day contributes to increasing the prestige of this institution.</p>

It won a FAD award in 1974.  Its designers were strongly influenced by the early 1950s Californian schools; they were schools without classrooms, conceived as a large open space or square. Influenced by this idea, Thau School was created as a large space without walls for pupils.  The most important criteria when it came to defining the project included searching for a very compact building, using as few walls as possible, carefully designing the exterior (described by the architects as ‘the city inside the school&#8217;) to encourage children to socialise, and the solar control system, thanks to which blinds separated from the façade allow air circulation and indirect light.  The three-metre wide corridors and other common areas were planned for use as teaching areas; in fact, the corridors are currently used as ITC classrooms.</p>

<p>Vil·la Joana is a very imposing old farmhouse that was built in the 18th century and later turned into a <strong>Neoclassical-style</strong> residence. It stands on <strong>Carretera de l’Església</strong>, in the natural surroundings of <strong>Parc de Collserola</strong>. The fact that it was in these hills and had belonged to a friend of Jacint Verdaguer&#8217;s, Ramon Miralles, is the reason the poet, afflicted by tuberculosis, decided to spend the final years of his life there.</p>
<p>The leading figure in the <strong>Catalan Renaissance</strong> died in Vil·la Joana in 1902 and, since then, the house has preserved the essence of his time there, leaving the rooms he occupied as they were.</p>

<p>Some time after his death, Barcelona City Council bought Vil·la Joana from its former owners. Initially it was turned into a pioneering school but late it became a house museum, the <strong>Museu-Casa Verdaguer</strong>.

<p>Until the exhibition re-opens, it will not be possible to see again the <strong>numerous reminders</strong> of the author of <em>Canigó</em> and <em>Atlàntida</em>, such as his writing desk, his office and his bedroom, in the house gallery. Despite that, the avenue through the estate offers a chance to discover the vegetation that inspired Verdaguer, who was an expert on plants and trees, and enjoy the natural poetry away from the noise of the city.</p>

<p>With the distinction of having been the first club to inspire a love of tennis in Spain, the <strong>Reial Club de Tennis Barcelona </strong>is today a highly prestigious institution. With <strong>over one hundred years of history</strong>, it has been the setting for many an exciting moment in the history of the sport. <strong>Forty-five Davis Cup</strong> <strong>preliminaries</strong> have been held at the club&#8217;s facilities, where players of the calibre of <strong>Conchita Martinez, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario </strong>and <strong>Carles Moya</strong> have trained, as has one of the greatest champions in history, <strong>Rafael Nadal</strong>, among others.</p>
<h3>Historical Background</h3>
<p>Founded by <strong>several English families in 1899</strong>, the Reial Club de Tennis Barcelona was a <strong>pioneering club</strong> that enjoyed its heyday in the 1950s with the creation of the <strong>Comte de Godó Trophy</strong> and the Davis Cup triumphs on the legendary <strong>Talisman Court</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>current building&#8217;s base</strong> dates back to <strong>medieval times</strong> and only a few <strong>windows with ogee arches</strong> have been preserved, resting <strong>above a few sculpted capitals, typical of Catalan Gothic.</strong> The building’s general structure is the result of several extensions carried out in the 17th century, a period when the property passed into the hands of the Canet family, after whom the farm is named. It was acquired by the Barcelona Royal Tennis Club in 1954, which then revamped the whole building and redeveloped and adapted the farm for new social uses. It also remodelled its agricultural fields to make them suitable for playing tennis on. The club facilities in the <strong>Pedralbes neighbourhood</strong> offer a range of options, including learning to <strong>play tennis and paddle tennis</strong>, attending competitions, swimming in the pool and, above all, <strong>enjoying the pleasure of sport </strong>in a unique environment.</p>

The following year, the school moved to the farmhouse of Can Llobet on Carrer Sant Sebastià. The school and the chapel were set alight during the events of Tragic Week in 1909. Between 1923 and 1926 the architect Joaquim Vilaseca i Ribera (1885- 1963) reformed the school and the original chapel. During the Spanish Republic, fearing the seizure of the school by the government, which had decreed the suppression of religious schools in 1932, the monks created the Mútua de Pares de Família (a religious society). With the outbreak of the Civil War, the school buildings were used as a field hospital and the place of worship suffered more damage. In 1964 the chapel of the school became the Parish Church of Jesús, Maria i Josep, by order of Bishop Modrego. Sant Josep Manyanet was canonized in Rome in 2004 and then the church was remodelled, a chapel being built in mem­ory of the twenty martyrs of the congregation, who were beatified in 2013. The church became a sanctuary when the remains of the saint were moved there, buried in the main altar, who died in 1901. The sculptor Francesc Carulla i Serra (1927) made a high-relief altarpiece in travertine for the church. The Manyanet Memorial, unveiled in 2008, collects objects, photos and publications that chart the life and work of the saint and his influence worldwide.</p>

The mosaic preserved in this church is neoclassical in style. </p>,"<p>Designed by the architect Joan Torras Guardiola (1827- 1910), from Sant Andreu himself, this church was com­pleted in 1881 in the Gothic style. The mosaic floor, created by the marble worker Luigi Pellerin, was designed by Antoni Gaudí (1852-1926), a pupil of Torras Guardiola at the Pro­vincial School of Architecture. Initially, this place of worship was the chapel of the convent school of the Congregation of the Religious of Jesus and Mary. When they relocated to Sant Gervasi, the nuns sold the building to the Brothers of Christian Schools, the Marists, who used it for their novitiate and a school for boys. Burned during the Tragic Week of 1909, the Marists sold all the property, and the chapel was used as a warehouse for grain and pulses until 1923, when the bishopric of Barcelona bought the place of worship. In 1924, on the feast day of Sant Pacià, the new church ten­ure was granted, depending on the Parish of Sant Andreu. Sant Pacià eventually became a parish in 1930. In 1936, the local revolutionary committee of Sant Andreu seized the parish church premises and the place of worship became a soup kitchen until the end of the war. Under several layers of paint, we can still see the acronyms of the CNT (National Labour Confederation) and FAI (Iberian Anarchist Federa­tion). Murals by Eudald Serrasolses and the Risen Christ, carved by the sculptor Juan Maria Medina Ayllón, were unveiled in 1985 in the Capella del Santíssim (a chapel). Gaudí’s mosaics were restored in 1988 by Lluís Bru. The Parish Church of Sant Pacià was the second place of wor­ship to be burned during Tragic Week in 1909. After burning the Parish Church of Sant Andreu, the rebels stormed this place of worship the next day, ransacked it, and finally burned it. During the Spanish Civil War, the church was confiscated by the local revolutionary committee of Sant Andreu and it became a soup kitchen called Menjadors Durruti</p>
<h3>Gaudí, the disciple</h3>
<p>The mosaic decorates the church&#8217;s central corridor and transept. Sant Andreu&#8217;s municipal architect Joan Torras Guardiola designed the church in 1879. At the time it was the chapel of the <strong>convent </strong>of the Congregació de Josep i Maria nuns, hence the letters J and M in the mosaic. Antoni Gaudí had been his disciple and the architect commissioned him with designing the mosaic.</p>

<p>The building is in perfect state of repair and many Gothic elements still remain today, including the <strong>large decorated windows</strong> on the facade, the <strong>lancet-arch doorway, </strong>the courtyard and the interior staircase, and for this reason it was declared a <strong>site of local cultural interest in Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<h3>Good use of a heritage space</h3>
<p>Torre Llobeta was converted into a <strong>civic centre</strong> in 1983; today it is a space that is open to everyone and it offers music, cookery, language and theatre workshops as well as classes in traditional dances, such as the Sardana. Using this <strong>historic building</strong> to provide quality public services to the neighbourhood has seen Torre Llobeta become a place much loved by locals and one that is very necessary for them, it cannot be dissociated from the past and present history of the Nou Barris district.</p>

<h3>The complex</h3>
<p>The building, which took 11 years to complete (1895 to 1906), was designed by Ignasi C. Bartrolí and based on the <strong>classicist trend</strong> of the time.

The temple was built by Brother José de la Concepción following the traditional canons of the Catalan Baroque, while the <strong>three-tiered façade</strong> topped with a triangular pediment is common in Carmelite churches of the period.</p>
<h3>The beginnings of a neighbourhood</h3>
<p>The Josepets church witnessed the growth of an entire village that ultimately took its name. By association with the Santa Maria de Gràcia convent, the village was also called Santa Maria de Gràcia (or Virgin of Gràcia or Our Lady of Gràcia), which was later shortened to just Gràcia. As a further reference to the Virgin, the district’s coat of arms features the Marian symbol of <strong>three white lilies </strong>on a blue background.</p>
<p>The church has always had close ties to the community, and apart from its religious activity, the parish is linked to several associations including the <strong>Esplai Josepets </strong>leisure centre</p>

<p>Parish churches regularly held workers&#8217; movement meetings during the final years of the Franco dictatorship. Clergymen such as Mossèn Josep Maria Vidal i Aunós, the Rector of Sant Medir, shared a commitment to freedom for workers and their social struggles and wage demands, thereby prompting churches in working-class neighbourhoods to work hand in hand with the new labour unions. Built as a parish in the late 1940s, with Mossèn Amadeu Oller as its first Rector, Sant Medir was identified from then on with the defence of the city&#8217;s oppressed and workers’ groups, in addition to its commitment to Catalonia. It was in Sant Medir that Abbot Escarré held his last mass before taking the road to exile; and decades later, the parish church provided a refuge for a group of 40 immigrants as an act of rebellion against the Alien Status Act issued by the Spanish government under Prime Minister Aznar.

<p><strong>An innovative library</strong></p>
<p>The library has a surface area of 3,300 square metres and it is the first public building in the city to have a <strong>BREEAM certificate</strong>, a leading method for assessing and certifying building <strong>sustainability</strong>. Another new feature is that the library is connected to the <strong>Fab Ateneu Les Corts</strong>, an incubator associated with the &#8216;maker&#8217; or do-it-yourself movement. An association that reciprocally benefits the dynamics of both of these singular facilities, providing better access to information and knowledge. The library therefore specialises in the &#8216;maker&#8217; culture, which promotes innovation and open knowledge, with the aim of designing and manufacturing things, especially technological or craftwork objects, with the support of digital tools and materials.</p>
<p>The library takes its name from the poet <strong>Montserrat Abelló</strong> (Tarragona, 1918 &#8211; Barcelona, 2014). Her poetry concerns being a woman and her experiences during the war and in exile. In 2007, she received the Cavall Verd award, the Jaume Fuster award for Catalan Language Writers, the Catalan Literature Honour Award and the National Culture Award.</p>
<p><strong>From a silk ribbon factory to a cultural factory</strong></p>
<p>The architects Ricard Mercadé and Aurora Fernández undertook the conversion project for the old Benet Campabadal factory, which was built in <strong>1924</strong> and was a pioneer in silk ribbon production . The factory was open for many years, but the constant rise in land prices forced it to close in 1984. In 1990, it became the home of the Fundación Centro del Vidrio [Glass Centre Foundation] a meeting point for glass trades, industry and art. The Fab Ateneu Les Corts opened its doors there in 2013. This is a digital creation and training centre linked to new technologies, and above all, to 3D digital manufacturing.</p>",2019-02-26 13:08:24,Inmaculada Torres Manresa,en,776985,ca,https://eldigital.barcelona.cat/pits/biblioteca-montserrat-abello,es,https://eldigital.barcelona.cat/es/pits/biblioteca-montserrat-abello,en,https://eldigital.barcelona.cat/en/pits/biblioteca-montserrat-abello,Districte Eixample,2019-03-07 09:26:08,2019-03-07 09:19:09,"<p>Since 2018, the building that used to house the Benet Campabadal silk ribbon factory has become the new district library, the Biblioteca Montserrat Abelló, which contains around 45,000 documents. 34,700 of them are bibliographic and 10,300 are audiovisual.

It consists of a complex formed by the church itself, the parish facilities, and the school of the same name located by the façade and adjacent to Carrer Collblanc.  There is a powerful bell tower attached to the façade, made from the same stone as the rest of the complex and in the same Neo-Romanesque style; it has a quadrangular plan and five levels of twin-window openings. It has semi-circular portals with tympanums decorated with narrative mosaics, which tell the life of the saint.  The reason for the initial building lies in the large-scale immigration and the growth experienced by this area since the 1920s. It was burnt down, together with the parish house, in July 1936. It was rebuilt between 1940 and 1955 (when the main altar was installed), designed by the architect Josep M. Sagnier, who gave it its current appearance.  There are several passages around the church, and perpendicular to the avenue of the same name, that have given rise to an authentic and unique neighbourhood of small, single-family and single-storey houses.</p>

<p>Just a few minutes from the cathedral, you will find a <strong>vibrant and multicultural neighbourhood</strong> that is buzzing with activity. This area has a wide variety of small restaurants, shops, studios and terraces, to which people of all imaginable professions from all over have come and where they coexist in harmony. Workers, poets and anarchists, humble as well as powerful people, musicians, thieves and even bandits such as Joan de Serrallongan have lived in the neighbourhood of Sant Pere in days gone by.</p>
<p>This all began back in the 10th century when the foundation of the monastery of Sant Pere de les Puel·les saw the arrival of people from all parts and these people then settled in the vicinity. A <strong>villa extramuros</strong> (a town outside the walls) had already existed there in the 12th century, and at the end of the 13th century it was included inside the new city walls.</p>
<p>The convent was demolished in 1873 and the religious community moved to Sarrià, where it still remains to this day. The neighbourhood was then left with only one church.</p>
<h3>The refurbished church</h3>
<p>The stone wall that we can see from the plaza is evidence of the <strong>thousand and one changes</strong> that this church has undergone over the years. While the portal is from the 15th century, many other elements have been lost and others were added at later stages: the original floor in the shape of a Greek cross was modified in one subsequent reform, the apse was also replaced, and a bell tower was built in the fifteenth century only to be replaced years later. In 1911, the church was rebuilt following a fire but it burnt down again during the Civil War before finally being restored again in 1945, giving it the <strong>eclectic appearance</strong> that it has today. In spite of all these changes, we can still see some traces of the church’s Romanesque origins in the interior, and its exterior appearance with its imposing portal reminds us that this was the birthplace of a great medieval district. </p>

<p>Plaça del Pi is well known for its church and the pine tree standing in its centre. The façade of the basilica, with its simple lines, houses an enormous rose window, the biggest one in Catalonia. The bell tower is 54 metres high and decorated with Gothic arches. The interior of the church is austere, with a central nave flanked by side chapels, one of which is owned by the city&#8217;s retailers&#8217; guild, which has a building in Plaça del Pi, just in front of the church, on the corner with C/ Petritxol. It is home to the oldest sgraffito in the city, dating from the seventeenth century. In the square is another house worth stopping to look at: the <strong>14th century Congregació de la Puríssima Sang </strong>building. Notable features include a Renaissance door and a row of pillared arches on the top floor.</p>
<h3>A bohemian square</h3>
<p>The area around the Plaça del Pi is frequented by <strong>bohemian artists</strong>, particularly painters, who display their paintings in the square off to the side, Plaça Sant Josep Oriol. Plaça del Pi is also well known for the <strong>Food Crafts People Collective</strong> Fair, offering stalls packed with delicious products every first and third Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the month.</p>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s history is closely tied to the sea, so it had to have a museum to explain all about that link. The site chosen was the old royal shipyards, the Reials Drassanes, which bear witness to the city&#8217;s <strong>seafaring past</strong>. Galleys and part of the fleet of the <strong>old</strong> <strong>Crown of Aragon</strong> were built there, warships were repaired and it was a store for equipment, tools and supplies. A whole history and lots of uses linked to the sea that it now bears witness to.</p>
<h3>A historic building</h3>
<p>The Drassanes were built backing onto the city&#8217;s <strong>second medieval walls</strong>, like a huge military fortification, and the yards still preserve the remains of the bastions in <strong>Plaça de Santa Madrona</strong>, as well as one of the entrance gates and part of the old walls.</p>
<p>The most curious thing about them is that for more than two centuries after they lost their original use, they were turned into a military foundry making cannons for the army, a barracks, an arsenal and an artillery store. Just before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, the army handed them over to the city, which immediately turned them into the Maritime Museum. And since the 1970s, Barcelona&#8217;s Royal Shipyards have been a <strong>Historical Artistic Heritage Site </strong>.</p>
<p>Today the <strong>splendid halls</strong> devoid of columns, with their high ceilings and gigantic arches, once used to build warships, promote the city&#8217;s <strong>maritime culture</strong> in a museum through which pirates, Vikings, the remains of the <em>Titanic</em> and big scientific discoveries have all passed in exhibitions where the sea has always been the common thread. The <strong>Museu Marítim de Barcelona</strong> (MMB) is open to everyone, adults and children, linking the city even more closely to the sea It is a place to enjoy the maritime world, visual and interactive, and part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, which aims to make the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage available to everyone.</p>

However, the history of this site goes back to a much earlier time, when, in 1923, the architect <strong>Francesc de Paula Nebot</strong> built the theatre to house a <strong>cinema</strong> for Josep Solà i Guardiola, Victorià Saludes and the Marquis of Argentera.</p>
<p>Inspired by the <strong>Paris Opera</strong>, the building adopts a style similar to that made popular by the <strong>French <em>beaux-arts</em></strong> movement, with a <strong>monumental facade and</strong> <strong>two neo-baroque columns</strong>. The whole is crowned by a great dome. Designed by Valeri Corberó, this feature has been used by various cultural organisations over the years.</p>
<h3>A unique theatre venue</h3>
<p>All kinds of films have been shown on the <strong>Coliseum&#8217;s screen, </strong>and the theatre has always hosted a <strong>varied programme of entertainment </strong>featuring different artistic disciplines, including dance, opera, and classical and popular music. Managed by <strong>Grup Balaña</strong> since 1958, this has become an essential venue at which to <strong>enjoy the best on the Barcelona performing arts scene</strong>.</p>

<p>Situated on Avinguda de Pedralbes are the estate pavilions that Count Eusebi Güell commissioned architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong> to build in the late 19th century. Famous for their colourfulness and forms, which are faithful to Gaudí&#8217;s most curious architectural style, these pavilions are full of <strong>mythological and aesthetic details </strong>that make them one of the architectural gems of Barcelona. This was the <strong>first project </strong>that Eusebi Güell commissioned Gaudí to undertake and it marked the start of a lengthy collaboration that resulted in many great works in the city. Between 1884 and 1887, Gaudí redesigned the garden and built the <strong>two pavilions </strong>at the entrance that we know today. With a stone base, these gatehouses feature walls the are heavily adorned with <strong>brick and ceramic </strong>elements. The project, with <strong>oriental airs</strong>, is even reminiscent of Mudejar art in some parts. The star feature of the construction are the entrance gate railings, featuring an <strong>iron dragon </strong>with glass eyes, in honour of the mythological dragon guarding the Garden of the Hesperides. The gate led into the Jardins de les Hespèrides, following the <strong>re-creation of the poem <em>L’Atlàntida</em></strong>, by Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer, and together with the Font d’Hèrcules (Hercules Fountain) in the Pedralbes gardens, forms part of the same tale.</p>
<h3>Inside</h3>
<p>In 1969, the pavilions were declared a <strong>National Historical and Artistic Monument </strong>and, until 2008, they served as the seat of the Royal Gaudi Chair, belonging to the Polytechnic University of Barcelona. Currently they are open to the public at the weekends and are well worth a visit although, if you only get the chance to go there on a week day, it is still worth going along just to see them from the outside, guarded by their foreboding dragon.</p>

<p>The medievalistic features were introduced with the idea of reproducing the main door and window decoration of an <strong>old house </strong>on Carrer de la Portaferrissa, <strong>Casa Gralla</strong>, which was demolished in the 19th century.

<p>In Barcelona the <strong>industrial revolution </strong>was particularly important throughout the 19th century<strong>, </strong>and was based around the textile industry. As it was a walled city, the new factories set up in the nearby towns, like Sants. The Vapor Vell factory opened in this <strong>former independent municipality,</strong> which today is part of the city. With its innovative use of steam, it was considered to be one of Catalonia&#8217;s <strong>great modern factories</strong>.</p>
<p>The construction of the building, owned by Güell, Ramis i Companyia, began in 1844, and two years later it began producing velvet. It became one of the most important factories in the sector, as it provided employment for <strong>thousands of workers</strong>, but the 1889 cotton crisis led to its closure. The following year <strong>Eusebi Güell</strong>, the son of the founder, moved the business to Colònia Güell, an industrial village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló.</p>
<h3>Culture in motion</h3>
<p>Since then, the building has been used for many different things. One of the most unusual came just after its closure as a factory, when the pioneering filmmaker <strong>Fructuós Gelabert</strong> chose the courtyard for shooting the main scene in <em>Riña en un café</em>, considered to be Spain&#8217;s <strong>first feature film</strong>.</p>
<p>It subsequently passed through many hands, from the CNT (the anarchist trade union) in the Civil War to the Rumasa company in the 1970s, until finally, in the middle of the 1980s, it was acquired by the City Council, who decided to convert this industrial complex into a <strong>local library</strong>, which was officially <strong>inaugurated in 2000</strong>.</p>
<p>Considered to be a <strong>historical monument </strong>and piece of cultural heritage, the building which today houses the <strong>modern Biblioteca</strong> <strong>Vapor Vell</strong> continues to be a driving force in the neighbourhood, encouraging and <strong>developing culture </strong>in Sants. You can participate in discussions, book clubs, conferences, workshops and a whole host of other activities that take place every day in this place full of <strong>history and memories</strong>.</p>

<p>The painting of Pruna (Barcelona, 1904-77) is characterised by religious mysticism and a <strong>predilection for angels</strong>. These themes also impregnate the chapel&#8217;s frescos, which he painted between 1952 and 1954. In 1970, the nuns sold the convent&#8217;s land, but the chapel was acquired by Barcelona City Council. After remaining closed for a long period, restoration work began in 1998, giving the chapel its present-day appearance. The same year, the centre joined Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>civic-centre network</strong>, having been named after Pere Pruna as a tribute to the artist.</p>
